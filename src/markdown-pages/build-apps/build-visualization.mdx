<Intro>

Building your own visualizations for New Relic dashboards enables you and your organization to query data from any source and display it on your dashboard. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the CLI to generate a visualization file structure, run it locally where you can quickly test and iterate, and then deploy it for use in a dashboard.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

To get started, make sure you have a [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup?utm_source=developer-site) account.

To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Complete all the steps in the [CLI quick start](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==).

## Create a new visualization

In this first set of steps you use the CLI to quickly generate the boilerplate for a new visualization.

<Steps>

  <Step>

Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI:

```bash
nr1 update
```

  </Step>

  <Step>

Start with a new Nerdpack. If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like, `my-awesome-nerdpack`). If you need to create one, run `nr1 create` and select the `nerdpack` option.

```bash
nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack
```

  </Step>

  <Step>

Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project, and then run the `nr1 create` command and select the visualization option.

```bash
cd my-awesome-nerdpack
nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization
```

As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the `visualizations` directory in the root of your nerdpack project.

  alt="Visualization files generated by CLI"

The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query.

The `nr1.json` file provides metadata including the `configuration` field that defines the prop input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are:

- `boolean`
- `string`
- `number`
- `json`
- `nrql`: a single NRQL query string.
- `namespace`: groups a set of props together in the prop editing UI under a heading.
- `collection`: defines a set of fields that can be repeated and result in an array prop type. The `nrqlQueries` entry is an example of a collection type.

The `index.js` file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any javascript libraries you find useful. The example component imports [recharts](https://recharts.org), a library that wraps [D3](https://d3js.org) submodules for easy to compose visualizations.

If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the `timeRange` value from [PlatformStateContext](/components/platform-state-context). The `timeRange` can be passed directly to the [NrqlQuery](/components/nrql-query) component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's `pollInterval` prop to `NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL` automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval.

```js
<PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
  {({timeRange}) => (
    <NrqlQuery
      timeRange={timeRange}
      pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL}
    >
    ...
```

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Render the visualization in local development

Now you run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations, where you can quickly test changes to your code.

<Steps>
  <Step>

Start the local node server for your Nerdpack.

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

<Callout variant="important">

To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local node server. For example, changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local node server and start it back up.

</Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>

In a browser, open [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local). This url is also shown in the terminal when the node server starts. The `nerdpacks=local` query string will direct the UI to load your new visulization artifact from the local node server.

<Callout variant="tip" title={`Advanced nerdpack configuration`}>

See the [advanced nerdpack
configuration](build-apps/build-hello-world-app/#advance-configurations)
section for detailed information about how your local node server is proxied
to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed.

</Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>

Open the **Apps** page, and navigate to **Custom Visualizations**, which you will find favorited by default.

<img
  src="../../images/build-an-app/visualization-apps-navigation.png"
  alt="Apps navigation is located in the New Relic One top navigation"
/>

  </Step>

  <Step>

In the **Custom Visualizations** listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the node server and refresh the browser.

When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local node server is rendered with prop configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps.

  </Step>

  <Step>

You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The props inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the `nr1.json` file in the visualization folder (for example `./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json`). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered.

<img
  src="../../images/build-an-app/visualization-builder-props.png"
  alt="Generated visualization rendered in the Visualization Builderr"
/>

  </Step>

  <Step>

Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for `fillOpacity` on the Radar component in `index.js`. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update.

```js fileName=visualizations/your-visuzalization/index.js
  fillOpacity={1.0}
```

  </Step>

  <Step>

To add more props, you must update the `configuration` field in the `nr1.json` file for your visualization, and restart the local node server. The props you define in the `configuration` field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a props editing UI for those using the visualization. See above for more information about the `configuration` field.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Deploy and use your visualization

When your visualization is ready to be added to dashboards by you and your colleagues, follow these steps.

<Steps>

  <Step>

Open and follow the guide to [publish and deploy the nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it](/build-apps/publish-deploy).

  </Step>

  <Step>

Then you can [add your visualization to a dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/add-custom-visualizations-your-dashboards).

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Summary

Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the steps to:

- Create a visualization and run it locally
- Quickly test and iterate on visualization code changes in Custom Visualizations
- Deploy a visualization
- Add a custom visualization to a dashboard
