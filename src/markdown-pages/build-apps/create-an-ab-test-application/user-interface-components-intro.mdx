If an application is organized, it is more readable and more understandable. In your A/B test application, you have a lot of charts, but no organization. In the next few lessons, you’ll use user interface components to bring some organization to your application and provide new functionality. First, you’ll use a `Grid` component to arrange your charts to match the layout in your design guide. Then, you’ll add headings to clarify what each chart represents. Finally, you’ll create a section for ending your A/B test. Before you add user any user interface components to your application, remind yourself of how your application will look when you finish:

Before you add headings or create new functionality, you’ll arrange your charts to look like they do in your design guide.
