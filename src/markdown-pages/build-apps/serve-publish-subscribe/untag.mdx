## Undeploy your app

You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy.

<Steps>

<Step>

To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run `nr1 subscription:list`.

</Step>

<Step>

Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the `nerdpack-id` option of the `unsubscribe command`:

```
nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID>
```
You should get a result like this: `Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>`.

</Step>

<Step>

Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2:

```
nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE
```

You should get the result `Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel`.

</Step>
