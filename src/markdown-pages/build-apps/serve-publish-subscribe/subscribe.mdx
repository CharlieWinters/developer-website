<Intro>

Subscribe to an app or visualization to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from apps and visualizations you no longer use.

</Intro>

## Check your permissions

To subscribe to an app or visualization, you need:

- Access to the account that published it
- The [necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks](/build-apps/permission-manage-apps)

## Publish your Nerdpack

You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them:

1. [Publish your Nerdpack](/build-apps/publish-deploy/publish)
2. [Tag your Nerdpack](/build-apps/publish-deploy/tag) if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag

## Subscribe to an app or visualization

Subscribe to a published app or visualization, with either the web UI or the `nr1` CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what apps and visualizations you use in your account.

<Callout variant="tip">

When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your app or visualization automatically.

</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>

Go to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com):

![Homepage](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/home.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to **Apps**:

![Navigate to the Apps page](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/nav-to-apps.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Find your published app or visualization under **New Relic One catalog**:

![Published app or visualization](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/published-app.png)

All published apps and visualizations are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the app or visualization you're looking for:

![Filter the catalog](../../../images/build-an-app/catalog-filter.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Select the app or visualization you want to add to your New Relic account:

![Select an app or visualization](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/select-account-maturity-app.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Add this app**:

![Select Add this app](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/add-this-account-maturity-app.png)

This button says **Manage access** if you're already subscribed to the app or visualization.

</Step>

<Step>

Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s):

![Subscribe to the app or visualization](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/subscribe-to-account-maturity-app.png)

<Callout variant="tip">

In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to **tags** as **channels**. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms.

</Callout>

Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the app or visualization from New Relic.

</Step>

<Step>

If you subscribed to an app, find it under **Your apps**:

![Your apps](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/account-maturity-under-your-apps.png)

If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under **Custom visualizations**:

![Navigate to Custom visualizations](../../../images/build-an-app/nav-to-serve-publish-subscribe.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Subscribe from the command line

If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your app or visualization with the `nr1` CLI.

<Steps>

<Step>

Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory:

```sh
cd my-awesome-nerdpack
```

For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as `my-awesome-nerdpack`.

</Step>

<Step>

Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:info
[output] Id: {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890
[output] Region: {muted}us
[output] Account ID: 1234567
[output] Local version: 1.0.0
[output] Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED
[output] Version Count: 1
[output] 
[output] Version  Date               Tags
[output] -------  -----------------  ------
[output] 1.0.0    {muted}a few seconds ago  {green}STABLE
```

You should see at least one [published](/build-apps/publish-deploy/publish) version with a [tag](/build-apps/publish-deploy/tag). It doesn't have to be `STABLE`. You can subscribe to any tagged version.

</Step>

<Step>

Subscribe to your Nerdpack:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE
[output] Subscribed account {green}1234567{normal} to the nerdpack {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890{normal} on the {green}STABLE{normal} channel
```

Here, you've subscribed to the `STABLE` tag. You can also subscribe to `DEV` and `BETA` tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI.

Similar to the web UI, the term **channel** `nr1 nerdpack:subscribe` is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Technical detail">

`nr1 nerdpack:subscribe` is an alias for `nr1 subscription:set`.

Read the [`nr1 subscription:set`](/explore-docs/nr1-subscription#nr1-subscriptionset) documentation to learn more. Or, view the `nr1` help page:

```sh
nr1 subscription:set --help
```

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Unsubscribe from an app or visualization

Unsubscribe from an app or visualization to remove it from your account.

<Steps>

<Step>

Go to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com):

![Homepage](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/home.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to **Apps**:

![Navigate to the Apps page](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/nav-to-apps.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Click the "i" icon next to the app or visualization you're subscribed to:

![Navigate to the Apps page](../../../images/build-an-app/click-info-icon.png)

This opens the detail page.

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Manage access**:

![Manage access](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/account-maturity-manage-access.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts:

![Unsubscribe from your app](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/unsubscribe-account-maturity.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Unsubscribe using the command line

Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from apps or visualizations.

<Steps>

<Step>

Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory:

```sh
cd my-awesome-nerdpack
```

</Step>

<Step>

View your profile's subscriptions:

```sh
nr1 subscription:list
[output] {muted}Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account:
[output] Version  UUID                                  Name              Date         User
[output] -------  ------------------------------------  ----------------  -----------  -------
[output] 0.6.4    {purple}384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641{normal}  Account Maturity  {muted}a month ago{normal}  2774472
```

</Step>

<Step>

Unsubscribe from the app or visualization with the UUID:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641
[output] Unsubscribed account {green}1234567{normal} from the nerdpack {purple}384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641{normal} on the {green}STABLE{normal} channel.
```

<Callout variant="tip">

`nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe` is an alias for `nr1 subscription:unset`.

Read the [`nr1 subscription:unset`](/explore-docs/nr1-subscription#nr1-subscriptionunset) documentation to learn more. Or, view the `nr1` help page:

```sh
nr1 subscription:unset --help
```

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack

Sometimes, when you subscribe to an app or visualization, you may come across issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues.

### Tag your app or visualization

When you subscribe to an app or visualization, you choose a specific tag. So, if the app or visualization you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, [tag](/build-apps/publish-deploy/tag) your release version:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV
[output] {error}›{normal}   Error: Nerdpack {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890{normal} is not deployed to channel {green}DEV{normal}. You have to deploy it first
[output] {error}›{normal}   Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED
[output]
nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV
[output] {success}✔  Tagged {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890{normal} version {green}1.0.0{normal} as {green}DEV{normal}.
[output]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV
[output] Subscribed account {green}1234567{normal} to the nerdpack {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890{normal} on the {green}DEV{normal} channel.
```

If you subscribe without a `--channel` argument, the default channel is `STABLE`, so make sure you have a `STABLE` version in this case:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe
[output] {error}›{normal}   Error: Nerdpack {purple}ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890{normal} is not deployed to channel {green}STABLE{normal}. You have to deploy it first
[output] {error}›{normal}   Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED
```

### Subscribe with the web UI

When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a `--channel` argument to select a tag. A **channel** is, for all intents and purposes, a **tag**. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning.

However, while the terms are synonymous, using `--channel` is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a `--channel`, you can only choose between `DEV`, `BETA`, and `STABLE`. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA
[output] {error}›{normal}   Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: {green}DEV{normal}, {green}BETA{normal}, {green}STABLE
[output] {error}›{normal}   See more help with --help
[output] {error}›{normal}   Code: UNKNOWN
```
