## Publish your app

Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a **Nerdpack manager**.

New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time.

<Callout variant="tip">

If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run `nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE` or `nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA`.

</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>

Update the `version` attribute in the app's `package.json` file.

This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish.

<Step>

To publish your Nerdpack, run `nr1 nerdpack:publish`.
