<Intro>

Details about permissions required for creating and managing [New Relic One applications](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps).

</Intro>

There are several factors affecting your New Relic One app permissions. 

## Basic user restrictions 

The most important permissions factor is [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type): 

* **Basic users** can only develop New Relic One apps locally. They canâ€™t publish or subscribe to an app, whether it's deployed in their account, available in [the public catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks/), or one they've built. 
* **Full users** can theoretically do everything, but there may be restrictions due to custom role assignments (see below). 

## Role-related permissions 

Full users have role-related rules that impact their ability to subscribe accounts to New Relic One apps. How this works depends on your account/user model: 

* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): Owners and Admins can manage New Relic One apps, as can users specifically assigned the **Nerdpack manager** add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see [Account access](#account-access)
* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the ability to publish and subscribe to apps is dependent on the "modify Nerdpacks" [capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#roles). The **All product admin** role has this capability, as do the default groups [**Admin** and **User**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups). 

To learn more about account/user models, see [User model overview](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).

## Account access

For organizations with master/sub-account structures: 

* If you add New Relic One apps to a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts.
* Applications that you create and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means that, if the app needs to be available across your organization, you might need a New Relic admin to deploy your app.
