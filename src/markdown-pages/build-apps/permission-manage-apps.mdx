There are several restrictions around who can publish, use, and subscribe to Nerdpacks (the file packages that represent [New Relic One applications](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps)). 

## Restrictions for basic users

The most important permissions factor is [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type): 

* **Basic users** can use default New Relic-built Nerdpacks (those available in the [**Apps** UI page](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks/)), and build their own Nerdpacks locally. They can't: 
  * Use Nerdpacks that are not the default New Relic-built ones.
  * Publish a Nerdpack they've built or subscribe accounts to it. 
* **Full users** can use Nerdpacks, both the New Relic-built ones and any Nerdpacks the account they're in has been subscribed to. Full users theoretically have all Nerdpack management permissions, but there may be restrictions related to custom role assignments (see below). 

## Role-related restrictions

For full users, there are role-related rules that may impact one's ability to manage Nerdpacks (publish them and subscribe to them). How this works depends on your account/user model: 

* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): Owners and Admins can manage Nerdpacks, as can users specifically assigned the **Nerdpack manager** add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see [Account access](#account-access)
* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the ability to manage Nerdpacks is dependent on the "modify Nerdpacks" [capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#capabilities). That capability is included in the [**All product admin** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles), which both the default [**Admin** and **User** groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups) have. And it can also be assigned to a custom role. 

To learn more about account/user models, see [User model overview](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).

## Account access

For organizations with master/sub-account structures: 

* If you subscribe to a Nerdpack from a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts.
* A Nerdpack made by your team can only be subscribed to from the master account that was used to publish it, or from its sub-accounts. This means that, if the Nerdpack needs to be available across your organization, you may need a New Relic admin to deploy it.
