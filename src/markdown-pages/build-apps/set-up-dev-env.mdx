<Intro>

If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: 

- The New Relic One command line interface (CLI)
- An API key, which you get when you download the CLI

Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers:

- Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps
- Contribute content to this website


</Intro>

## Before you begin
You must have:

- A [github account](https://github.com/) account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to [download and customize our open source apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects), and contribute an [open source project](https://opensource.newrelic.com/contributing/). 
- A [New Relic developer account](https://newrelic.com/signup/?partner=Developer+Edition) - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - If you've installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then you already have `npm`, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website.

## Prepare to build or modify apps

<Steps>

<Step>

## Download the CLI and API key

On the [Build New Relic One applications page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==), complete the **Quick start** steps.

These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following:

- A **Nerdpack** - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher.
- One or more **Nerdlet** files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an `index.js` file, a `stylesheet`, and a JSON-format `config` file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). 
- A `launcher` file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. 

</Step>

<Step>

## Start building

If you're ready to code, `cd` to your Nerdpack and get started.

If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides:

- [Build a "Hello, World!" application](/build-apps/build-hello-world-app) shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it.
- [Map pageviews by region](/build-apps/map-pageviews-by-region) takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.
