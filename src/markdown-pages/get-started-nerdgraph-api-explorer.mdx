## What is the NerdGraph API Explorer

NerdGraph is New Relic's [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API. With NerdGraph you can get all the information you need in a single request: no matter how much data you pulled into New Relic, our GraphQL API can help you navigate that complexity and gain more insight.

NerdGraph is different from REST APIs in that you don't need to chain several calls to obtain the required data. Instead, you use the Graph query language to retrieve JSON objects from our graph, which is spread across our many microservices.

The beauty of the NerdGraph API Explorer is that you don't even need to know what the final query must be like: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the desired items and filling out required values.

In this guide we'll show you how to use NerdGraph to compose queries and how to turn them into cURL or New Relic CLI snippets.

## Get Started with NerdGraph API Explorer

Go to [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and log in using your New Relic user and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer will load up.Before you begin, make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer.

The Query Builder is in the left sidebar and lets you search, browse, and select graph fields. In the center is the GraphQL query editor, which comes with syntax highlighting and autocompletion. Clicking the play button will run the query, the results appearing as JSON on the right sidebar.

## Your first NerdGraph query

Time for your first NerdGraph query! Erase everything in the query editor and select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: `actor`, `user`, `name`. This GraphQL snippet should appear in the editor:

```jsx
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

With this query, we are telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. We are asking for the `name` field, which is nested within `user` field (the user owning the API key), which in turn is nested within `actor`. Click the play button to see the result:

```jsx
{
  "data": {
    "actor": {
      "user": {
        "name": "Your name"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {...}
}
```

The result has almost the same shape as the request; all the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor.

Now try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: NerdGraph API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In this example, we are adding the account `id` and `email` fields.

```jsx
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: 12345678)
  }
}
```

Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching of data. Notice that the `id` field has an argument: passing arguments is a very powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can carry arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need.

## Experiment with mutations

In GraphQL, [mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) are a way to execute "queries with side effects", that is, queries that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (the usual set of CRUD operations you be used to from REST APIs).

Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor, scroll down the Query Builder, expand `mutation`, and select the fields as in the following screenshot:

![Mutation example](../images/graphql-guide/mutation-example.png)

In this case, we're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor will complain if you don't select `errors`: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses).

> Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you tried adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. 

## Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal

Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations, select the **Tools** menu. From there you can copy the query as a cURL call or as a [New Relic CLI](...) command.

![Tools menu](../images/graphql-guide/tools-menu.png)

Here's what the first query we created in this guide would look like as cURL:

```sh
curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \
  --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  actor {\n    user {\n      name\n      email\n    }\n    account(id: 12345678)\n  }\n}\n", "variables":""}'
```

And here's its New Relic CLI equivalent:

```sh
NEW_RELIC_REGION=US NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY_REDACTED newrelic nerdgraph query '{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: 12345678)
  }
}
'
```

Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation.

## What’s next?

All the power of the New Relic data graph is a few clicks away. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).
