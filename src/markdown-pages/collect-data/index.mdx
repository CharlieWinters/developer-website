<Intro>

New Relic provides a lot of data "out of the box," through our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Infrastructure products, but maybe you want to capture data that's not collected by default. Perhaps you'd like to collect data using APIs instead of installing agents. Or bring in telemetry data from another service altogether. The guides in this section provide strategies for collecting and querying data for use in your existing New Relic implmentation, or in apps you create or modify. The opportunities are endless.
