<Intro>

This guide steps you through adding access to the New Relic time picker to a sample transaction overview application. You also add the selected time to the queries used in the applicationâ€™s chart components. Start by setting up the sample application and running it locally. Then add the time picker, and some time picker features.

This guide requires that you have the following:

- A github account
- New Relic developer account
- API Key
- New Relic One CLI downloaded

<br/>

### Set up the sample application

You can use this application for trying things out. Or, skip this section and start with "Add time picker" below, if you just want to add the time picker to an existing applicaiton. 

<Step stepNumber="1 of 4" title="Clone the example application">

This repo contains an example application and code that supports a handful of how to guides for cool and useful features you migth want in your applications. If you've tried other how to guides, you might have already cloned this repo, in which case, you should probably go ahead and update from master.

```shell lineNumbers=false
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="2 of 4" title="Set up and run the application locally">

Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal,  change to the time picker directory.

```shell lineNumbers=false
cd /nr1-howto/add-time-picker
```
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="3 of 4" title="Make sure you're getting data from the right New Relic account">

In your preferred text editor, open the `/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js` and then edit the following line to use your account ID (find your account ID in the Profile section of the Developer Center, where you downloaded the New Relic One CLI):

```jsx
this.accountId = <REPLACE ME WITH YOUR ACCOUNT ID>;
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="4 of 4">

Update the UUID and serve the application by running the following:

```shell lineNumbers=false
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

</Step>

# Next Steps

You'll get a URL to access New Relic One and see your application running locally: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local

One the New Relic home page, there's a new launcher to the Add time picker application.

Click the launcher, and the dashboard opens with your New Relic account transactions.
