<Intro>

Here's how you can quickly build a "Hello, World!" app and publish it to your local New Relic One Catalog.

In these steps, we'll show you how to create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your ideas. Then, when you are ready, you can publish your code to the New Relic One Catalog.

## Before you begin

To get started, complete a few easy steps in our installation wizard at [Build New Relic One applications](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==). The wizard helps you get a personal API key, download the New Relic CLI (command line interface), and configure your environment.

After you complete the wizard, continue with the steps below.


## Create a local verion of the "Hello, World!" application

The command line inteface allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic.

Here's how to create a local verson of "Hello, World!":

<Steps>

  <Step>

If you haven't already done so in your terminal, change to the new directory named after your nerdpack project. For example, it might look like this:

  ```
  $ cd /my-awesome-nerdpack
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>

Open up a code editor.

<Important>Your code editor displays two artifacts: `launchers` (contains the homepage tile) and `nerdlets` (contains your application code).</Important>

  </Step>

  <Step>

Expand `nerdlets` in your code editor, and open `index.js`.

  </Step>

  <Step>

Change the default `return` message to `Hello World!` (or anything else):

  ```js
  import React from 'react';
  
  // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction

  export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component {
      render() {
          return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
      }
  }
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>

As an optional step, you can add a custom tile icon using any image file named `icon.png`. Replace the existing `icon.png` file under `launcher` by dragging in your new image file.

![Launcher artifact with icon.png](../images/create-hello-world/custom-tile.png)

  </Step>

  <Step>
  
To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under `launchers`, open `nr1.json`.
    
  </Step>  
    
  <Step>

Change the value for `displayName` to anything you want, and save the file:  

  ```json
  {
    "schemaType": "LAUNCHER",
    "id": "my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher",
    "description": "Describe me",
    "displayName": "INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE",
    "rootNerdletId": "my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet"
}
```

  </Step>

  <Step>

To see your new changes locally, start the node server with this command in your terminal:

    ```
    npm start
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>

Open a browser and go to `https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks='local' (this url is also shown in the terminal).

  </Step>

  <Step>

When the browser opens, click the new launcher for your application. Here's our example where we inserted a leaf icon:

![The customized nerdlet launcher](../images/create-hello-world/hello-world-launcher.png)

  </Step>

</Steps>

After you click the new launcher, your "Hello, World!" appears:

![Hello, World in the browser](../images/create-hello-world/hello-world-output-local.png)

## Publish you application to New Relic





## Summary

After you completed the steps in this example, you successfully created your first "Hello, World!" application in New Relic One.
