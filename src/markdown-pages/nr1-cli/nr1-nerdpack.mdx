# Command details

***

## `nr1 nerdpack:clone` 
### Clone an existing Nerdpack
Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can select an open source Nerdpack to clone from [our GitHub repository](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects/). After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using it:
1. Clones the repository.
2. Sets the repository as remote upstream.
3. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm).
4. Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commit it.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `-r, --repo=REPO`  | Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). **(Required)** |
|  `-p, --path=PATH`  | Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). |
|  `-f, --force`      |   Replaces destination folder if it exists. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

*** 

## `nr1 nerdpack:serve`
### Serve your Nerdpack locally
Launches a local server with your Nerdpack on your [New Relic One platform](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), where it's ready for testing and development. For details on working with apps locally, see our details on how to [serve, publish and deploy documentation](/build-apps/publish-deploy/).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:serve` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

<br/>

*** 

## `nr1 nerdpack:uuid`
### Show or generate your Nerdpack's UUID
 By default, prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of the specified Nerdpack. This ID dictates the data a Nerdpack has access to and who can subscribe to it. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID. Use the `-g` or `--generate` option to generate a new UUID.
 For more details, see the [Access to data page](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/guide-to-authentication--data-access--and-permissions#Appaccesstodata) and [our workshop](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop/blob/master/lab-cli/INSTRUCTIONS.md) on GitHub.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:uuid` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `-f, --force`       | If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. |
|  `-g, --generate`     | Generates a new UUID if not available. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

<br/>

***

## `nr1 nerdpack:publish`
### Publish your Nerdpack
Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. After publishing, you can use `nr1 nerdpack:deploy` to deploy it to a channel and make it available to users. For more on publishing and deploying, see [Deploy to New Relic One](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/publish-deploy).
Please note:
* If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. 
* If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the `--channel` option. For example, `$ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE`.
* If you want to disable this behavior, add `--skip-deploy` to the command. Then, you can use `nr1 nerdpack:deploy` to perform a deploy manually.


### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:publish` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
| `-B, --skip-build`                          | Skips the previous build process. |
| `-D, --skip-deploy`                        | Skips the following deploy process. |
| `-c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE`            | Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] |
|  `-f, --force`                              |  Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. |
|  `--dry-run`                                 | Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. |
|  `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path` | Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] |
|  `--prerelease=STRING`                   | The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`                      | The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:deploy`
### Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel
Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. 
For more on publishing and deploying, see [Deploy to New Relic One](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/publish-deploy).

### Usage
`$ nr1 COMMAND OPTION` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `-c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE` | Specifies the channel to deploy to. **(required)** |
|  `-i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID` | Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. |
|  `--from-version=VERSION` | Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`  | The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |
