<Intro>

To help you build a [New Relic One application](/use-cases/build-new-relic-one-applications),
we provide you with the [New Relic One SDK](/client-side-sdk/index.html).
On this page, youâ€™ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted
storage solution.

</Intro>

## Using NerdStorageVault in your apps

NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensative secrets data such as:

- personal access tokens
- license keys
- API keys
- other third party secrets

<Tip>

NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption

</Tip>

## Usage considerations

- This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack.
- NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack.
- You cannot directly make a mutation to NerdStorageVault.
- You can explore the fields and response types via the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
- The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user.

<Tip>

A trusted nerdpack ID header value (service-gateway-external-package-id)
is provided by service gateway when requests come from nerdlets and
that header value is required by this service to fulfill requests.

</Tip>

## Component Library

Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the [Nr1 Community component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/nr1-community/v/1.3.0-alpha.4)
and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment
Nr1 core components for additional functionality.

### Write

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
mutation {
  nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: "test", value: "secret_test") {
    status
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}

```

### Delete

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
mutation {
  nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: "test_key", value: "test_value") {
    status
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}

```

### Fetch a single secret

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
{
  actor {
    nerdStorageVault {
      secret(key: "test_key") {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}


```

### Fetch a list of secrets

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
{
  actor {
    nerdStorageVault {
      secrets {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}


```

### Limits

- A maximum of 10 secrets can be store per ACTOR.
- A secret value is limited to 5000 characters.
- A key value is limited to 64 characters.

### Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault

In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as creating, updating,
and deleting data, you must have a
[user role with permission to persist changes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles).
