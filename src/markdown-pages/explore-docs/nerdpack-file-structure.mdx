<Intro>

A [New Relic One application](https://developer.newrelic.com/use-cases/build-new-relic-one-applications
"Link opens in a new window.") is represented by a **Nerdpack** folder, which can include one or more **Nerdlet** files,
and (optionally) one or more **launcher** files. Here we explain: 

- The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher
- How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet
- How to link your application with a monitored entity

For basic component definitions, see our [component reference](/reference/intro-to-sdk).

</Intro>

## Generate Nerdpack components

There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template:

- **Generate a Nerdpack**: Use the [New Relic One CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/cli "Link opens in a new window.") command `nr1 create` and select `Nerdpack` to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher.
- **Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually**: Use the [New Relic One CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/cli "Link opens in a new window.") command `nr1 create` and choose either a Nerdlet or a launcher. This may be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack.

For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see [our workshop](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop/blob/master/lab0/INSTRUCTIONS.md "Link opens in a new window.").

## Nerdpack file structure

When you generate a Nerdpack template using the `nr1 create` command, it has the following file structure:

```bash copy=false lineNumbers=false
my-nerdlet
├── README.md
├── launchers
│   └── my-nerdlet-launcher
│       ├── icon.png
│       └── nr1.json
├── nerdlets
│   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet
│       ├── index.js
│       ├── nr1.json
│       └── styles.scss
├── node_modules
│   ├── js-tokens
│   ├── loose-envify
│   ├── object-assign
│   ├── prop-types
│   ├── react
│   ├── react-dom
│   ├── react-is
│   └── scheduler
├── nr1.json
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```
<br />

## Nerdlet file structure

A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, `index.js`, `nr1.json`, and `styles.scss`. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the `nr1 create` command:

### `index.js`

The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet.

```jsx copy=false lineNumbers=false
import React from 'react';

export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>
  }
}
```

### `nr1.json`

The Nerdlet configuration file.

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
{
  "schemaType": "NERDLET",
  "id": "my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet",
  "description": "Describe me",
  "displayName": "MyAwesomeNerdpack"
}
```
<br/>

Besides using the [launcher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#launcher-file)
as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with
a monitored entity to get it to appear in the New Relic One [entity explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts). To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: `entities` and `actionCategory`.

In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all New Relic Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the **Monitor** UI category :

```json copy=false lineNumbers=false
{
  "schemaType": "NERDLET",
  "id": "my-nerdlet",
  "description": "Describe me",
  "displayName": "Custom Data",
  "entities": [{"domain": "BROWSER", "type": "APPLICATION"}],
  "actionCategory": "monitor"
}
```
<br />

To see this application in the UI, you would go to the New Relic One
[entity explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts),
 select Browser applications, and select a monitored application.

### `styles.scss`

An empty SCSS file for styling your application.

### `icon.png`

The launcher icon that appears on the [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com/)
home page when an application is deployed.

## Launcher file structure

When an application with a launcher file has been deployed, its launcher is located on the New Relic One home page ([one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") ). Note that:

- A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can  [associate your application with a monitored entity](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#nerdlet-json).
- An application can have more than one launcher; this may be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets.

After generating a launcher using the `nr1 create` command, its folder contains two files:

### `nr1.json`

The configuration file.
```json  copy=false lineNumbers=false
{
    "schemaType": "LAUNCHER",
    "id": "my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher",
    "description": "Describe me",
    "displayName": "MyAwesomeNerdpack",
    "rootNerdletId": "my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet"    
}
```
<br />

To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the  `rootNerdletId`  must match the  `id`  in the launched Nerdlet's  `nr1.json`  config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet.

### `icon.png`

The launcher icon that appears on the  [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") home page when an application is deployed.
