## `nr1 nerdpack:build`

### Builds a Nerdpack
Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack.

### Options
| | |

|  `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path`  | Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] |
|  `--prerelease=prerelease`                    | If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be "1.2.3-abc". |

## `nr1 nerdpack:clone`

### Clone an existing Nerdpack
Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from [our Open Source GitHub repositories](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects/). After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack:
1. Clones the repository.
2. Sets the repository as remote upstream.
3. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm).
4. Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION`

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `-r, --repo=REPO`  | Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). **(Required)** |
|  `-p, --path=PATH`  | Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). |
|  `-f, --force`      |   Replaces destination folder if it exists. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

*** 

## `nr1 nerdpack:serve`
### Serve your Nerdpack locally
Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the [New Relic One platform](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), where it can be tested live. 

To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to [serve, publish, and deploy documentation](/build-apps/publish-deploy/).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:serve` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

<br/>

*** 

## `nr1 nerdpack:uuid`
### Get your Nerdpack's UUID
Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the `-g` or `--generate` option.

For more details, see [our GitHub workshop](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop/blob/master/lab-cli/INSTRUCTIONS.md) on GitHub.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:uuid` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `-f, --force`      | If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. |
|  `-g, --generate`   | Generates a new UUID if not available. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

***

## `nr1 nerdpack:publish`
### Publish your Nerdpack
Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. 

Please note:
* If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. 
* If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the `--channel` option. For example, `$ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE`.
* If you want to disable this behavior, add `-D` or `--skip-deploy` to the command. Then, you can use `nr1 nerdpack:deploy` to perform a deploy manually.

For more on publishing and deploying, see [Deploy to New Relic One](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/publish-deploy).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:publish` 

### Options
| | |

|  `--dry-run`                                 | Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. |
|  `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path` | Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] |
|  `--prerelease=STRING`                       | The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`                         | The authentication profile you want to use. |
