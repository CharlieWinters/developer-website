      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can set time ranges with New Relic Insights by using a time picker or by using NRQL queries for event widgets. Insights always displays the query results based on your browser's time zone. Chart refresh intervals vary based on the specified time frame. Also, the date ranges available to query depend on your subscription level and data retention period for the New Relic product you are querying. Set time range using time picker Use the time picker to quickly set relative time ranges or to set time ranges with specific start and end timestamps. New Relic automatically offsets your browser's time zone when viewing the results. When using the time picker to set a custom date range, you can select a maximum range of seven days on the calendar. The time picker's appearance and functionality vary, depending on the chart or page you are viewing. Set time range using NRQL For event widgets, NRQL allows more control over the time range than the time picker. Use NRQL clauses SINCE and UNTIL to set the time range with relative timestamps or UTC timestamps. To specify the time zone offset for the queried data, use the method appropriate to the type of range you are using. Relative time range (phrase or numerical unit) Use relative timestamps to run quick queries, or to create dashboards that are always relevant to the current day/time and won't require constant updating. Some points to note when using relative time range: \"Day\" is a 24 hour period. \"Month\" is a 30 day period, regardless of the length of the calendar month covered by the query. \"Year\" is a 365 day period, regardless of whether the year covered by the query is a leap year. Relative time does not take into account daylight savings time. A day continues to be 24 hours regardless of whether the clock changed due to daylight savings time. Tip Use the WITH TIMEZONE argument in your query to return results based on your location's time zone offset. Specifying the time zone ensures the returned data starts and ends on the hour/day/week/month/etc. instead of starting and ending in the middle of them. Query data for current business week You can use SINCE Monday at '08:00' UNTIL Friday at '17:00' to represent a business week, and review the complete data on Saturday: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE Monday at '08:00' UNTIL Friday at '17:00' WITH TIMEZONE America/Los Angeles Copy Query to see highest traffic days of week This query returns data from the PageView Browser event that returns the count of page views from the app named docs.prod. The page view counts are split by days of the week for the past 3 months. The data returned stops at 00:00 on Monday of the current week, so the query returns the data in calendar weeks and not seven-day ranges that flow across calendar weeks. SELECT count(*) as 'PageViews' FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'docs.prod' SINCE 3 months ago UNTIL monday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/Los_Angeles' facet weekdayOf(timestamp) Copy \\[SINCE | UNTIL] integer units AGO This query provides a chart comparing the 50th, 95th, and 99th percentile of average response time. The start or end of the time range would be 7 days prior at the current time. In this example, if the current date and timestamp is Tuesday, November 9 11:20am, this query's time range would start on Tuesday, November 2 11:20am. SELECT percentile(duration, 50, 95, 99) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO Copy Other supported units include: X minutes ago X hours ago X days ago X weeks ago X months ago \\[SINCE | UNTIL] yesterday When used in the SINCE clause, this time range begins on the previous day at midnight/00:00 UTC. When used in the UNTIL clause, this range would end on the previous day at 23:59:59 UTC. \\[SINCE | UNTIL] Wednesday You can specify any day of the week as the start or end of a time range. When used in the UNTIL clause, the returned data does not include data from the specified day, because the time range ends at the beginning of the specified day. When used in the SINCE clause, this example time range begins on Wednesday at 00:00:00 UTC. When used in the UNTIL clause, this example time range would end on Tuesday at 11:59:59 UTC. \\[SINCE | UNTIL] \\[this hour | last hour] When used in the SINCE clause: this hour = time range starts at beginning of current hour. last hour = time range starts at beginning of previous hour. When used in the UNTIL clause: this hour = time range ends at beginning of current hour. last hour = time range ends at beginning of previous hour. \\[SINCE | UNTIL] \\[this week | last week] When used in the SINCE clause: this week = time range starts at beginning of current week (Monday at 00:00:00 UTC). last week = time range starts at beginning of previous week (previous Monday at 00:00:00 UTC). When used in the UNTIL clause: this week = time range ends right before beginning of current week (previous Sunday at 23:59:59 UTC). last week = time range ends right before beginning of previous week (two Sundays ago at 23:59:59 UTC). \\[SINCE | UNTIL] \\[this month | last month] When used in the SINCE clause: this month = time range starts at beginning of current month (1st of current month at 00:00:00 UTC). last month = time range starts at beginning of previous month (1st of previous month at 00:00:00 UTC). When used in the UNTIL clause: this month = time range ends right before beginning of current month (last day of previous month at 23:59:59 UTC). last month = time range ends right before beginning of previous month (last day of two months ago at 23:59:59 UTC). \\[SINCE | UNTIL] \\[this quarter | last quarter] In this example, assume the current date and timestamp is August 10 at 11:25:00. When used in the SINCE clause: this quarter = time range starts at beginning of current quarter (in this example: July 1 at 00:00:00 UTC). last quarter = time range starts at beginning of previous quarter (in this example: April 1 at 00:00:00 UTC). When used in the UNTIL clause: this quarter = time range ends right before beginning of current quarter (in this example: June 30 at 23:59:59 UTC). last quarter = time range ends right before beginning of previous quarter (in this example: March 31 at 23:59:59 UTC). UTC timestamp UTC timestamp syntax is: yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:ss Copy To refer to a specific date or time, use UTC time as an SQL-style timestamp in a single quoted string. You can also adjust the UTC timestamp to a specific time zone: Query using UTC timestamp with time zone offset To adjust UTC time to a specific time zone , include the hours adjustment in the query. For example, include a minus sign (-) for time zones west of UTC or a plus sign (+) for time zones east of UTC with the number of hours. This example shows Eastern Standard Time (EST) in North America, which is five hours west of UTC (-0500): SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00-0500' Copy If you use NRQL in an Insights query API call, the + and - characters must be URL-encoded. Query using UTC timestamp with time zone label To include the time zone label in the queried range, add a time zone acronym to the timestamp. For example, to clarify that the query shows Eastern Standard Time, insert EST at the end of the timestamp. This example also shows Eastern Standard Time (EST) in North America, which is five hours west of UTC (-0500): SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00 EST' Copy Some abbreviations apply to more than one geographic location. For example, EST could mean Eastern Standard Time (EST) in North America or Eastern Standard Time in Australia. For clarity, you may want to use the numeric value to offset UTC time (-0500 for EST in North America or +1000 for EST in Australia). Use an APM time range If there is a specific time range in New Relic APM that you want to analyze in Insights, you can use the time code found in the URL to populate your NRQL query: On an APM page showing a time range, select Permalink. Inspect the copied URL, and get the UTC 10-digit times (located near the end of the URL) that represents the start and end of the time range. In a NRQL query, use the SINCE and UNTIL functions with the 10-digit UTC times to retrieve data for that specific time range. In the following example, the URL is generated by selecting Permalink in the New Relic UI: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/123456/applications/12345678?tw%5Bend%5D=1502388642&tw%5Bstart%5D=1502386842 Copy In the NRQL query, use 1502386842 as the SINCE value and 1502388642 as the UNTIL value.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page Here are two ways to reach the Summary page: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app). APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your Browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser details In order to view Browser details, you must enable this feature from Browser settings. However, if your app has never reported any browser monitoring data, you must first enable it from the application's settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application. From the New Relic Browser section, select the Enable browser monitoring? checkbox. Select Apdex values for browser monitoring and app server requests, or leave the defaults. Optional: Select up to five countries or regions for browser monitoring to highlight on the Geography page. Select Save application settings. To enable additional features, follow standard procedures from Browser > (selected app) > Settings. After New Relic Browser instrumentation is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding Browser Summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

Mobile monitoring in New Relic reports event data that is displayed in some UI displays and is also available for querying and charting. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description Mobile A Mobile event is created when a crash occurs, when an interaction ends or has run for 1 second, or if a session completes after the app is closed, backgrounded, or has run for 10 minutes. Mobile events were once the only event type and were generated for every event, but now there are several specialized event types. Recommendation: Upgrade to the most recent New Relic Mobile agent version to take full advantage of the new event types. MobileBreadcrumb There are no attributes listed for this event because it's a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes added. MobileCrash The MobileCrash event is created when an app crashes. MobileCrash includes attributes such as crash line number, class, and crash message. MobileHandledException MobileHandledException is sent when an exception is caught and is used for non-fatal exceptions reported to New Relic using the recordHandledException API call for Android or iOS. The exceptions will be visible in queries of this event and on the Handled exceptions UI page, including stack traces. MobileRequest A MobileRequest event is created when an HTTP request successfully completes, resulting in a response code below 400. To use this event type, you must have Mobile agent version 5.14.0 or higher for Android or iOS. New Relic MobileRequest data is enabled by default for: Android version 5.15.2 or higher iOS version 6.0.0 or higher For earlier versions, starting with Android version 5.14.0 or iOS version 5.14.0, you must enable the feature. Upgrade to the latest Android or iOS version, or enable the NetworkRequests feature flag by using the Android or iOS configuration settings. MobileRequestError A MobileRequestError is used for HTTP errors or network failures. HTTP errors are HTTP requests that have a status code greater than 400. A network failure is an HTTP request that results in no response. The event is sent when the HTTP request completes. For best results, use New Relic Mobile agent 5.14.0 or higher for Android or iOS. With lower agent versions, some attributes may be missing, and you will not have access to MobileRequest events. MobileSession A MobileSession event is sent when an app is closed, backgrounded, or when 10 minutes of active use has elapsed. This is the source of the general session data used by the other New Relic Mobile events. MobileSession captures attributes such as device type, device OS, and geographical information. Custom events There is no attribute list for this event type because it is a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes that you add.

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User For your convenience, we automatically load all users and their email addresses for the selected account. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. A user channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. A device is registered if the user has logged into New Relic using the mobile app on the device. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to...

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to...

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: you can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it’s under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option.

It is not working or it is sending partial data. Solution The NewRelic-log-ingestion lambda versions prior to 2.1 are being deprecated. Update to the latest lambdas published in the AWS Serverless Repository. You can either use the New Relic CLI or update manually. Recommended: The main way to update the log ingestion lambda function is to follow standard procedures to update the function using the New Relic CLI.

Remove the outdated lambda version of the lambda: Go to your AWS Lambda Console, and remove newrelic-log-ingestion. Be aware that this stops the RDS Enhanced Monitoring and the VPC Flow Logs integration until the next step is completed.

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User For your convenience, we automatically load all users and their email addresses for the selected account. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. A user channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. A device is registered if the user has logged into New Relic using the mobile app on the device. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. View plugin dashboard details Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your Plugins menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central. The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards. To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name. Plugin summary Depending on the plugin, the summary includes: One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair) Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts Other information about alert violations, events, and activity If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features. If you want to... Do this... View version information for a component's or instance's agent Mouse over the component's name. Change the sort order On the title row of the plugin's summary page, select the up or down arrow for a component (instance) or a summary metric's label. Show or hide items on the events and activity list Select an event icon, or select All. View details about an event On the events and activity list, select the link. View page details for a component or instance Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance). Plugin dashboards Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard dashboard features to drill down into detailed information. The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update. Plugin alerts If the plugin publisher set Critical (red) or Caution (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can: Select and view alert details. Change the existing thresholds. Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for Critical events. Delete a plugin Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's Download or Continue button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources. Remove plugin components (instances) At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray. Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides. Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings icon for each component (instance). Delete the plugin After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your Plugins menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin. If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: New Relic APM: Monitor your web apps with New Relic APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. New Relic Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with New Relic Infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic Infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. New Relic Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with New Relic Synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy New Relic APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the Infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [Browser] ( /docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using New Relic APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in New Relic Dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build Dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Plugin summary metrics Each component or instance for your plugin in Plugin Central can have summary metrics, such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count. The summary metrics appear on your plugin's Summary page in the Plugins user interface. The summary metric dashboards are also useful as a debugging tool to review all of the metrics sent by your plugin agent to New Relic. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select any summary metric value for it. You can also change various plugin settings in the UI. When you first create a summary metric for your plugin, this triggers a change to New Relic's collectors. This may cause your running components (instances) to stop showing summary metrics for a short period of time. For example, if you add a new summary metric to your plugin, any components (instances) you are monitoring that use that plugin may have all summary metrics temporarily cleared. This will also close any outstanding related events and alerts. Depending on the components and other factors, you may need to wait fifteen minutes or more before summary metrics appear again. Add summary metrics To add a summary metric: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. From the Summary metrics section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. If your plugin contains only one summary metric, you can identify the metric in the chart's title and then hide the legend (colored bars that label the metrics) that normally appears below the chart. Also, if you define negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Optional: Add alert summary metrics Plugin publishers and users can define alert conditions from the plugin's Summary page by selecting the component's or instance's settings icon. The alerts will be activated when the summary metric's specified values fall above the thresholds. The Recent events list for the plugin's components (instances) appears on the plugin's Summary page. To view additional details about an alert, select its name. Sometimes there may be a delay between the time that a summary metric event is triggered and the time that New Relic creates the corresponding incident and sends the alert notification. There are several timing mechanisms at work, such as collector caching, summary metric event timing, delayed job queues, email delivery, etc. Depending on the situation, this delay could be up to ten or fifteen minutes before the alert notification is sent. Time periods for metrics Metrics that appear in dashboards are reported with a duration. The end time is implied by the time New Relic receives the metrics. This is why you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting. The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show various time periods. You can also deliver data at one-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, New Relic aggregates when there is too much data, but it does not extrapolate if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30-minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear. Recommendation: Use a 60-second polling interval. Default dashboards show 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Plugin dashboards You can create dashboards to visualize the data generated by your plugins in New Relic. You must be a plugin author or publisher to add, edit, and delete dashboards. Plugin users cannot customize the plugin dashboards they acquire from Plugin Central. View the default dashboard New plugins automatically include a default dashboard. Once your plugin agent starts sending data to New Relic's Plugin API, you can view the default dashboard in New Relic's UI and change it as needed. To view the default dashboard for your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select a component (instance). Add dashboards In addition to the default dashboard, you can create as many additional dashboards for your plugin as you want. After you publish your plugin, all of these dashboards and summary metrics are available to plugin users. The customized dashboards that display plugin data are part of the plugin. Plugin users cannot add their own dashboards. This needs to be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin fork or update. To create additional dashboards: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. From the Dashboards section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. Specify a title for your dashboard, select a page layout, then select Create. From the new dashboard page, type a label for the new chart or table, and then select Add chart or table. Edit the chart, including the case-sensitive metrics (for example, a metric name you see in the agent output, such as Component/SIN[Value]) and value (for example, Total value). To use additional options (for example, number format), select Advanced options. Optional: Use a wildcard (*) to show multiple metrics on a chart. For example, to include the metric component/foo/bar and the metric component/foo/xyz, use the metric name component/foo/*.f Select Save and Preview to preview the chart or table. Or, select Save and finish when you are satisfied with the appearance of the chart or table. Review the new chart that appears on the customized dashboard, and continue adding, editing, or rearranging charts and tables on your dashboard as needed. When finished, select I'm done editing. Avoid metric grouping problems Wildcards provide flexibility for how your metric names appear. When creating a chart, consider whether you want the metric names to appear with identical namespace segments, or include a wildcard to strip the namespace segments. For example: Component/Database/Metric1 Component/Database/Metric2 Component/Database/Metric3 Copy OR Metric1 Metric2 Metric3 Copy To prevent problems with metric grouping issues, avoid defining values that result in excessively large numbers. For example, if a plugin's chart value is 1 widget and New Relic collects 3 million widgets, change the value to 1 million widgets so that the chart can show millions of widgets more efficiently. Also, avoid creating high-precision values containing many digits after a decimal point. Change or delete dashboards To update or remove any plugin dashboard, including the default: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. Keep a stable production version of your plugin that users can acquire from Plugin Central, and create a development version that you are actively improving, testing, browsing the presentation of metrics on your custom dashboard, or otherwise have in a non-production state. Plugin settings You can change several plugin settings before you publish the plugin. You can also make changes at any time to published plugins. Initial settings Before you publish your plugin, you can: Select a generic plugin icon for the Plugins UI. This is not the same as the URL for your customized branding image you may choose as part of the publishing process. Change your plugin's label for the Plugins UI. By default, this is the first 11 characters of the plugin's Title field. Change your plugin's title. The default title is your plugin's GUID. Add, change, or delete your plugin's summary metrics and their alert conditions. Add, change, or delete your plugin's dashboards. Exception: You can edit but you cannnot delete your plugin's default dashboard. To add, change, or delete plugin settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. When finished, be sure to save your changes. Additional updates After you publish your plugin, you can continue making changes. Recommendation: To avoid development and testing impacts on your users, maintain development and production versions. To make additional updates to your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From your plugin's Summary page, select Edit, Publish, or your component's (instance's) settings icon as applicable. Update the settings as needed, and then save your changes. When you are ready to release this version: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, select your plugin, and then select Publish. Here is a summary of where to view or make changes to your plugin. Type of change Edit Publish Settings Agent: Change the plugin's version (n/a in UI). Alert conditions, customized for components (instances) Alert conditions, defaults for summary metrics Branding image (URL) that appears in Plugin Central Components (instances): Remove from your plugin Dashboards: Add, edit, delete Description Developer Terms of Service Icon that appears in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (label) in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (title) in Plugin Central NPI Compatible designation Publisher's name Summary metrics: Add, edit, delete URL for installation and setup instructions URL for your support site URL for your website (\"About us\")",

Thus, you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting. The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show any time period you want; for example, 30 minutes, 30 days, etc. You can also deliver data at 1-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, data will aggregate when there is too much, but data will not be extrapolated if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30 minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear. Use a 60-second polling interval, because the default dashboard shows 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Metric data details The JSON data is a hash with two required keys at the top level: components: An array of components, each consisting of a hash of attributes for the individual component, including the metric data. agent: A hash describing the agent that is reporting metrics data to New Relic Plugins on behalf of the component(s). Of these values, only host and version are required. When graphing metrics, be aware that null = zero. Metric data POST Description Component data One of two required keys at the top level. This is an array of hashes describing the components that report metrics in this request. Each hash contains the following values: name A name ( < =32 characters) that uniquely identifies the monitored entity and appears as the display name for this agent. Note: Metric names are case sensitive. guid A \"reverse domain name\" styled identifier; for example, com.newrelic.mysql. This is a unique identity defined in the plugin's user interface, which ties the agent data to the corresponding plugin user interface in New Relic. duration The duration in seconds over which the metric data was collected. The end time is implied as the time the data is received by the API. metrics Timeslice data for each metric being reported. The hash keys are metric names, and the values are the timeslice data value for the named metric. Agent data One of two required keys at the top level. A hash specifying information about the agent that is reporting data on behalf of the components. host (required) The hostname of the agent monitoring the specified components. This is the hostname where the monitoring agent is running, not the hostname of the component being monitored. pid (optional) The process identifier of the agent monitoring the specified components. This is the process identifier of the monitoring agent itself, not a process identifier that may be associated with the monitored components. version (required) The version of the agent monitoring the specified components, using the format A.B.C where A, B, and C are integers. The version number must conform to the rules specified in standard Semantic Versioning scheme v2.0.0. Timeslice metric values Metrics are sent inside the component hash with the key metrics and a hash as a value. The hash keys are metric names, and the values are the timeslice data values for the named metric. The timeslice hash value uses one of three formats: Timeslice hash value Description A single scalar value with a floating point number or integer This is the simplest format, and this number is required. The reported value is used as the total, minimum, and maximum data value. The count value is assumed to be 1. The Plugin API does not support reporting of arbitrary string metrics, only scalar values that are aggregated. Array of five required values in specific order An array of five required integers or floating point numbers that represent, in order: Total value over the time period Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count Minimum value over the time period Maximum value over the time period Sum of squares for the samples over the time period Hash with five required key/value pairs in any order A hash with value names as the keys, and integers or floating point values as the values. All five key/value pairs are required. The keys of the hash are the type of timeslice data, and the value is the data value. These has key/value pairs can be in any order: total: Total value over the time period count: Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count min: Minimum value over the time period max: Maximum value over the time period sum_of_squares: Sum of squares for the samples over the time period Calculations Limited mathematical calculations are available with the key/value pairs, such as computing total, count, minimum, maximum, averages, and standard deviations. However, to do more extensive calculations, you need to do the math in the agent, and then send the results as a new metric. For example, send Metric1, Metric2, and Metric3 (which equals Metric1 divided by Metric2). If you submit negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Examples Here are some examples. Metrics \"metrics\" : { \"Component/Database/Primary[Queries/Second]\" : { \"total\" : 25, \"count\" : 2, \"min\" : 10, \"max\" : 15, \"sum_of_squares\" : 325 }, \"Component/Database/Secondary[Queries/Second]\" : [25, 2, 10, 15, 325], \"Component/Database/Backup[Queries/Second]\" : 10 } Copy cURL example curl -vi https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics \\ -H \"X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\ -X POST -d '{ \"agent\": { \"host\" : \"db.internal.your_company.com\", \"pid\" : 1234, \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" }, \"components\": [ { \"name\": \"Primary MySQL Database\", \"guid\": \"com.your_company_name.plugin_name\", \"duration\" : 60, \"metrics\" : { \"Component/ProductionDatabase[Queries/Second]\": 100, \"Component/AnalyticsDatabase[Queries/Second]\": { \"min\" : 2, \"max\" : 10, \"total\": 12, \"count\" : 2, \"sum_of_squares\" : 104 } } } ] }' Copy Metric references Refer to these references as you develop your own plugins. Metric naming guidelines Metric timeslice data uses a unique case-sensitive identifier, referred to as the metric name. In order for the metric to be rendered usefully in the user interface, the metric name must contain a prefix, category name, label, and optional units indicator. Here are some recommended guidelines for the text in metric names to make them more readable in the user interface. Metric naming guidelines Guidelines UI display Use case and whitespace characters appropriate for display in the user interface, because segments are rendered as-is in the UI. Category and label segments Metric names are case sensitive. Capitalize the first word in the category and label segments. Keep category and label segments as short as possible. Length There is a limit of 255 characters for metric names. Characters to avoid using Avoid using the following characters in names. These characters have special meaning and should not be used except where specifically required for their purpose. / ] [ | * Also avoid multi-byte characters. Units Use abbreviated names for units when possible. Metric segments Each of these segments is divided by the forward slash / character. Each segment is interpreted for a specific purpose in the UI and roughly follows this pattern: prefix/category/label[units] Copy For example, the metric representing the latency of cache hits reported by a plugin collecting data for a cache appliance might look like this: Component/Cache/Hits[sec|hit] Copy Metric segment order Notes Prefix: Component/ or Custom/ The first segment of a custom metric is Component/ (if it comes from a plugin agent) or Custom/ (if it is a custom metric collected by a New Relic agent. For example, Custom/MyMetric). Caution If you use the Plugin API only, and if the metrics do not start with Component/, they may not be available or may not appear correctly in charts and dashboards. Category name The second part of a custom metric is a category name, used to group metrics into different categories. For example, the metrics reported by a database plugin may fall into categories such as schema, tables, or connections. Label The third part of the metric name is used for labeling the data when it appears in tables and charts. If it contains multiple segments, each slash separating the segments of the label will be rendered as part of the label. Units The fourth segment of the metric consists of a units specification. Metric attributes Most metrics are defined statically and represent some global state; for example, cache size. Other metrics are dynamic and include some contextual attribute like the name of a host or a file. These metrics need to be structured so you can easily show them as a group in a table stacked in a chart. To add attribute names to a metric, put them in trailing segments separated by a forward slash / character. For example: Component/Disk/Bytes In/dev001 Component/Network/External services/ae592c3.aws.com Copy You can specify more than one attribute as long as they occupy the same position for a given metric category and label: Component/Tables/Row count/DB001/BLOG_POSTS[rows] Copy Caution Avoid overloading the metric space by putting in segment values that have a large range of values. While something like a customer's region in an attribute is a reasonable thing to track in the metric, the customer name would not be if you have more than a few hundred customers. If your agent starts sending an excessive amount of metrics, your metrics may be automatically collapsed into groups with wildcards: Component/Users/*[visits] Copy Metric values You can report a metric value in one of two ways: Single value: This typically is the value being reported for that time slice. If you use an SDK, you report the single value to the SDK. It handles tracking the rest of these values. Set of aggregate value: This includes the min, max, and sum of squares values for the value being reported. If you use the Plugin API, the preferred method is to report all of the values. When aggregating a series of timeslice data into a single timeslice data entry for a given period, all fields are summed except for the min and max value. If you are using an SDK plugins, this is done automatically. If you are using the Plugin API to develop plugins, you need to code for this. A metric value contains several fields, but it is represented primarily by the count and value. The count is a 32-bit integer field, and the value is a 32-bit float. Metric values can represent more than one data point or sample as an aggregation of measures. Typically the count is the number of samples, and the value is the total value of all samples. Here are the fields in a metric value: Metric value Description count The number of things being measured. If data is collected at the time the event occurs, like with some kind of injection, then the count in the timeslice data will be 1. Required if it is not 1 (0 generally represents an absent value). value Required: The total value measured across all things being counted. When averages are calculated later, we divide the value by the count. In some cases, the value field is irrelevant. min, max The minimum and maximum values when the count is greater than 1. When the count is 1, these are the same as the value. Optional depending on whether they are available or relevant for a given metric. sum of squares This is the sum of squares of each value and is useful when the values follow a standard distribution. You can only capture this value when you are collecting data each time the event happens. You store the value of the event in the value field and the square of the value in the sum of squares. This is used to calculate a standard deviation later on. The sum of squares is optional. It is used to calculate a standard deviation for a selection of data. If standard deviation for the value is not meaningful, such as when the values are not part of a normal distribution, then the sum of squares is omitted. Units When a metric value is collected by periodically sampling an interface, the count units are implicitly samples, and the value units are whatever is being sampled. For data it might be bytes. For throughput it might be something like kilobytes/second. For utilization (like CPU) it might be percent. When the count units are samples, they can be omitted in the metric name. Units of time, bytes, and bits may get special treatment, allowing additional conversion in the user interface between magnitudes. For example, if you specify a metric with units of kilobytes, then in the UI you may be presented the option of displaying a chart of Mb. Metrics units describe what the value field and count represent. Units are specified inside brackets and consist of units for the value, followed by a pipe (|) and then the units for the count. For example: Component/metric_id[value_unit|count_unit] Copy Exception: The pipe and count units (|[count_unit]) are not required after the value unit for samples. Rate metrics are commonly defined as sample per interval. This is defined as units/interval in the metric, with a forward slash to separate units from interval. For example: Component/metric_id[value_unit/interval] Copy In rare cases there will only be a unit value for count. The value will be interpreted as unitless. Value units are omitted, and the vertical bar appears in front of the count units. For example: Component/metric_id[|count_unit] Copy Units for plugin metrics Notes Naming conventions You can have mixed-case unit names. They.can consist strictly of alphabetical characters as well as the _, %, or / symbols. Case is preserved. Punctuation markers, dashes, spaces and any other symbols are not allowed. Recommendation: Use uncapitalized words, spelled out in full. For example, use second not sec. Rate metrics When a metric value represents a rate, such as bytes/second, then the value is assumed to be a sample for the given interval. The units specifier looks like [ bytes/second] since the count units are implicitly samples. For example: Component/metric_id[bytes/second] Copy The count units are samples (default) and the value units are bytes/second. The forward slash separates the units from the interval. Count with units A common case for declaring units is when measuring response times. If the custom metric represents the average latency of a call to a cache, then the units for the metric value are seconds per call. For example: Component/metric_id[seconds|call] Copy Count units are calls and value units are seconds. The default count metric is not being used, so you need to specify it. The bar separates the value units from the count units. Units in charts The units specified in a metric have several implications for the way the values are interpreted by generic charts and tables: Units display in labels and tooltips in charts to indicate what the values represent. Units imply a set of different values available from a single metric value. When creating a chart in a dashboard, the dashboard author selects one of the available value methods for that metric to plot in the chart.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' Copy Tip If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. ヒント To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. 注意 Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. 注意 Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest コピー Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest コピー View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME コピー When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts コピー If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update コピー Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY コピー To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY コピー Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods コピー Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME コピー Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID コピー Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% コピー Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME コピー Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help コピー To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion コピー helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion コピー Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE コピー Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... コピー OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... コピー Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer ヒント If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the chart builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your New Relic APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Tip Proactive Detection is automatically enabled and available at no additional cost. All that's required is data from your APM-monitored applications flowing into New Relic. To signup and take advantage of this and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

Similar to service maps, the dependencies page helps you understand how all of your upstream and downstream services are connected. It also uses the same color coding system used by service maps to show you what's performing well and what isn't.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization. Create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Query your data more easily At the top of all UI pages, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the NRQL mode query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience.

      "body": "In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time, and you need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data (we call those data sources entities). With the New Relic Explorer, we give you a new, efficient front-door experience to easily observe the full stack of your software. We automatically create and maintain visibility from the data you send us. Use the New Relic Explorer to access and give context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, containers, synthetic monitors, etc. You can quickly see the entities related to a problem, exposing possible root causes and what other systems might be affected. Tip To use New Relic One and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With the New Relic Explorer, it’s more than just observing the metrics: understand the root of what’s happening, not just the symptoms. Gain extensive visibility of each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected, at a glance. See all your workloads, and create a new one in a click. Get a high level view of how your system’s doing with the New Relic Navigator. Quickly grasp unusual trends and behaviors with New Relic Lookout. Filter and group related entities to quickly drill down to the issues. Troubleshoot issues with tools that are faster, less cumbersome, and more accurate. Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the New Relic Explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

Charts include: invocation counts, duration, throttles, and error counts. Distributed tracing The Distributed tracing page shows distributed traces that include the monitored Lambda function. For details about this feature, see Distributed tracing. Errors The Errors page displays errors (AwsLambdaInvocationError events). You can filter by error rate, error percentage, or error class. You can drill down into errors and see attributes and, if available, stack traces. Invocations The Invocations page lets you filter your invocations by attribute, and view duration, throughput, external calls, and invocation breakdowns. About invocation breakdowns: Some invocations will generate a breakdown if distributed tracing is enabled during instrumentation. Breakdowns are sampled; approximately 10% of invocations generate a breakdown. This sampling rate may be higher, depending on upstream sampling decisions. Logs The Logs page displays recent log messages from your Lambda function. For details about this feature, see Logs.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the New Relic Explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "Before you migrate any applications to the cloud, verify that the applications and their underlying server infrastructures are candidates for migration. When you instrument every layer of an application’s architecture, you get end-to-end visibility and are able to identify additional cloud migration risks or dependencies. Such analysis provides a more focused cloud migration priority list. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Instrument applications Before you install any New Relic agents, review the compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents. Then, install the agents in your environment. After installing the agents, review the architecture of all the applications that you instrumented with an agent. Take note of the host for each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), as you will install Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts in the next step. 3. Instrument hosts After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, follow the instructions for installing the Infrastructure agent on all hosts in your application stack: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Also, in order to report data to New Relic, Infrastructure agents must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system requires a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. Tip If you discover any applications, dependencies, or server infrastructure that you did not include in your list of components, instrument them with New Relic by installing the appropriate agents before moving forward. 4. Identify and track issues After installing, New Relic APM and Browser show you error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the Browser JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. 5. Create baselines One of the benefits of using APM while you are planning your cloud migration is that you get a deeper understanding of your application’s baseline. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. 6. Determine next steps Use the following New Relic features to determine the next steps for your application: Use service maps to find connections After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view into your application’s architecture. service maps allow you to identify any external services, web services, databases, or APIs that the application might be connecting to. Once you have an application node on the map, you can add its connections to the map, including New Relic Browser apps, databases, or external services (for example, third-party APIs). Every node you add is automatically connected to the map, so you see the shape of your application’s architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: Use service maps to understand the connections between different parts of your architecture. Use the New Relic Explorer to analyze health Use the explorer to see a high level overview of your services, which includes applications. Select the service to view a summary of your instrumented applications. You can then select dependencies to view the underlying infrastructure. To view this information at a glance, use the New Relic Explorer by going to one.newrelic.com > Explorer. From the explorer, you can: Sort applications by labels: Name Response Time Throughput Error Rate Identify owners Identify which users will be affected by a migration Discover application architecture details, such as the number of tiers and data sources Discover any dependencies Extract operational costs of each application or group one.newrelic.com > Explorer: The explorer allows you to see an overview of your services. Use the Inventory page to identify components Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. New Relic Infrastructure reports detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, and more. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. Use this data to identify various components of the applications you want to migrate. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: Use the filter and search functions to find information for specific items across all your hosts. Analyze these criteria for each of your apps to determine the next steps for your migration: Should you move your app to a new host or platform, or re-factor its code before migrating it? Should you retire the application without moving it to the cloud? By using the information that New Relic provides, you are better equipped to create a prioritized list of applications ready for cloud migration. Expert tips for organizing your data In APM, use labels to group the instrumented applications into meaningful categories like environments, functional areas, technologies, business units. Or, you can separate them for development or operational teams. In Infrastructure, use filter sets to organize hosts into cluster, environment, role, or any Infrastructure attribute based on criteria that you define.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorer's Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard pricing tier includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Access and requirements You'll need a New Relic Insert API key. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting If you receive an NrIntegrationError, see Troubleshoot a NrIntegrationError event.",

This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "Caution This document is for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers. Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); Copy To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Copy Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); Copy To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Copy Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Copy Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) Copy The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) Copy With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights Caution The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Copy Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) Copy NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Copy Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); Copy boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); Copy IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); Copy public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) Copy If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); Copy RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Copy Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Copy Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Copy Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes Caution These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Used to instrument functions, methods, generators, and coroutines that aren't instrumented by default. Description function_trace is a decorator for adding to functions, methods, generators, and coroutines. Adding this decorator lets you collect additional transaction information (including transaction trace information). (An alternate way to instrument functions without having to touch your app code is to list them in the config file.) function_trace does not give you a full profile of all the functions that happen in a decorated function. What it does is add the decorated function as a node in the New Relic UI and capture the time spent in that function. If you need more detail about what is going on in that function, you would need to also apply the function trace to the function's child functions. The function_trace decorator can be used on generators and coroutines with agent version 2.102.0.85 or higher. Timing of these objects begins when consumption starts, and ends when the object is exhausted or goes out of scope. This is a change from earlier versions where the metric represented the time taken to create the generator or coroutine object itself. You can use the decorator in conjunction with existing decorators, including those for static and class methods. When nesting multiple decorators, have the function_trace decorator as the outermost decorator. Important For any decorators that are being wrapped, use functools.wraps() from the Python standard library in their implementation. (Or, otherwise ensure that the decorator propagates the correct name attributes of the innermost wrapped object required to allow correct name introspection.) If this is not done, then when the metric is reported, the name of the nested decorator function (not the innermost wrapped function) will be used. Alternate call forms For setups where you cannot use the decorator, these alternate call forms are available: The context manager The FunctionTrace context manager is used when the parameters to be passed cannot be determined before runtime. (For example, you may not know the name of a function at import time.) When using the context manager to name a metric, you must always supply the name and the metric path prefix. The FunctionTrace class implements the context manager and is used in conjunction with the with statement. The FunctionTrace class is the lowest level primitive available for tracing time against a transaction. The with statement defines the bounds of what is timed and not a single function. Thus, the context manager could be applied to an arbitrary block of code. The block of code could therefore contain calls to multiple functions, or it could be a self-contained block of code implementing a time-oriented algorithm that you want to track. Important Avoid tracing blocks of code that are called an excessive number of times. For example, do not use it within the context of a loop that executes many times. The data generated will incur a performance overhead. A better solution is to enclose the loop. The wrapper If you know in advance where the specific functions you want to trace are, you could use the function_trace decorator. However, if you don't know all the functions that need to be traced (for example, if they're being looked up dynamically as part of a routing system), then you must use the FunctionTraceWrapper to wrap the function at the time of registration or at the time of calling. Path-based wrapping wrap_function_trace is used for wrapping functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example: you might use this to instrument library code that you don't want to modify. For more about the differences between these call formats, see Different call formats. Parameters Parameters for decorator newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy This call includes these parameters: Parameter Description name string Optional. The function name. If not set, defaults to the captured name of the function. group string Optional. The group represents the naming structure for the name parameter. This is used in the UI for segregating the transaction types. If not supplied, the group will default to Function in expectation that the name is of the form module:class.function or module:function and represents the name of the function being executed. If you are creating a custom group, it's recommended you prefix it with Python/. label string Optional. Adds a callout-style flag to the segment in a transaction trace. Default is None. params dict Optional. Custom parameters to add to the segment in transaction traces. terminal boolean Optional. If true, no children segments will be recorded. Default is False. Parameters for context manager newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace(name, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the context manager includes all of the parameters from function_trace. The name parameter is required and not optional. Parameter Description name string Required. The function name. Wrapper parameters newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(wrapped, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the wrapper include all parameters for function_trace and a wrapped parameter: Parameter Description wrapped function Required. The function being wrapped. Path-based wrapping parameters newrelic.agent.wrap_function_trace(module, object_path, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters include all parameters for function_trace and these parameters: Parameter Description module object Required. The module containing the function to be instrumented. object_path string The path to the location of the function. Examples function_trace example An example of using the function_trace decorator: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy An example of using the function_trace decorator with native coroutines: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy Context manager example An example of using the FunctionTrace context manager: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) with newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace( endpoint, 'Python/EndPoint'): return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy Wrapper example An example of using the FunctionTraceWrapper: URL routing with Werkzeug yields a name that is used first to dynamically look up a method of a class using getattr() and the result then invoked: def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() return getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint)(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to trace the endpoint function, you can rewrite this as: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(function) return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to name the metric after the endpoint name (rather than naming the metric based on the identifier for the function being called), you can supply the name to use plus an alternate metric path prefix when the FunctionTraceWrapper object is created. import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper( function, name=endpoint, group='Python/EndPoint') return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy For this example, if the endpoint were called help, the final metric would be: Python/EndPoint/help Copy In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category would be Python and the segment name EndPoint/help. That segment name would also appear in slow transaction traces as the node name.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

You can list all the dashboard entities you have access to: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by name: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s email: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s userId: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type = 'DASHBOARD' and ownerId = \"2357322\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity GUID. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. In the example below we are only interested in the entity GUID and the name of our dashboard. { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid name } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example below is not complete but can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard GUID and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example is not complete but it can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardUpdate( guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\", dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity GUID. mutation { dashboardDelete { status errors { type description } } } Copy Errors as first class citizens As you might have noticed, all dashboard mutations offer you a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy",

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Copy Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Copy Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Copy Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } Copy List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Copy Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Copy Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. Caution This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Copy Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Access and requirements You'll need a New Relic Insert API key. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting If you receive an NrIntegrationError, see Troubleshoot a NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "When you create a condition, you set thresholds that determine what will open a violation. This document explains what thresholds are and how to set them. What is a threshold? For a condition, thresholds are the settings that determine what opens a violation. Depending on a policy's incident preference, a violation may result in: The creation of an incident. Notifications being sent. Examples of thresholds: An application’s average web response time is greater than 5 seconds for 15 minutes. An application’s error rate per minute hits 10% or higher at least once in an hour. An application’s AJAX response time deviates a certain amount from its expected baseline behavior. Besides a mandatory critical threshold level, you can also set thresholds for a less serious warning level, which doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. View and set thresholds Thresholds are set during the process of creating a condition: Goal Instructions Set thresholds for a new condition Set thresholds as part of the process of creating a condition. View and update thresholds for existing conditions To view a condition’s thresholds: find that condition in the UI. To update thresholds, select a condition’s thresholds and make changes. To learn more about specific alert condition types (like baseline and NRQL), see Types of conditions. Details about other functionality and rules: Use the Alerts API You can list and edit conditions with the Alerts API. Set optional warning level You can set thresholds for two levels: critical (required) and warning (optional). Threshold level Details Critical (red) Required. When a violation occurs, it will send notifications depending on incident preference settings. Warning (yellow) Optional. Doesn't open incidents or generate notifications, but will roll up into incidents that are already open. Use a warning threshold if you want to monitor when a system behavior is concerning or noteworthy but not important enough to require a notification. Loss of signal (NRQL only) A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by New Relic. This could be the result of an entity or service going offline, an issue with an agent or collector, or networking problems in a data center or the internet. You can use loss of signal detection to create a new violation and notification if a signal stops and you expect a service to be stable. You may also want to use this to determine when an ephemeral service stops and set the action to close any open violations that exist for this condition. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this announcement. Set time intervals Different condition types have different minimum time intervals. For example, some condition types have a minimum time interval of 5 minutes (for example, APM metric alert conditions), and others have a minimum time interval of 1 minute (for example, NRQL alert conditions).

For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your New Relic APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Tip Proactive Detection is automatically enabled and available at no additional cost. All that's required is data from your APM-monitored applications flowing into New Relic. To signup and take advantage of this and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "You might find that you ingest data you don't need or want. You can drop some types of data, which enables you: To filter out unimportant low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following types of data can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop events meeting certain criteria Let’s say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don’t look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Copy Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: you can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it’s under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Back to top icon New Relic Browser Overview Features Resources New Relic Browser features Sign up for free Page Load Performance JavaScript Errors Browser Performance AJAX Global Features Security Page Load Performance New Relic Browser is the world’s most deployed Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution because it’s easy to use, and instantly connects end-user experience with time spent in backend services. From easy-to-understand overviews to user-centric perceived performance metrics and events, Browser helps you benchmark and improve web performance and troubleshoot across your full stack. Full Support for Google’s Core Web Vitals By adding Cumulative Layout Shift, a score measuring the impact of sudden unexpected shifts in layout due to content dynamically resizing, we now offer full support for all three of Google’s Core Web Vitals for web health. Use NRQL to create dashboards for all three measurements, definitions below: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - measures loading performance First Input Delay (FID) - measures interactivity Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - measures visual stability User Centric Perceived Performance Web performance teams can use more modern metrics than just page load time to benchmark and improve end-user experience for their dynamic pages. Browser helps developers understand how code impacts customers, answering key questions on page performance. Monitor how long users wait for content to display (paint metrics), how long until users can interact with our page (interactivity metrics), and how long until marquee content renders (largest contentful paint). (see blogpost for more) Single Page App Route Changes View Single Page Application route change performance, regardless of what JavaScript framework you use. Powerful low-level instrumentation can even capture interactions beyond the route change that can be customized via API, allowing monitoring tailored to the architecture of your application, such as for custom frameworks. Session Traces Session Traces provide one of the most valuable assets an engineer requires - context. Beyond identifying long load times, and specific errors, Browser Session Traces provide the story that occurred both before and after an error or performance issue. Pivot from AJAX requests and JavaScript errors into a Session Trace and conversely pivot from a Session Trace out to a specific JavaScript error or Network error. Browser Traces Traces are snapshots of one user’s experience, surfaced as an outlier due to a longer than average load time. It provides details around when it took place, a segmented breakdown of where load time was spent, browser type, and the user’s geographic location. This report is excellent when dissecting areas of your application which are performing poorly for specific users. Page Load Time - Segmentation Chart Page load times capture metrics from the moment a user begins a transaction in the browser until the page completes loading. The reports show average page load time broken down into color-coded segments for: Request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Page Load Time - Histogram and Percentiles Histograms and percentiles of browser page load times provide a holistic view of the speed of page loads, one that is not focused on averages alone. Histograms and percentiles surface every page load that occurred during a specified time window, providing the ability to drill into outliers that might have been overlooked otherwise. Geographic Reporting Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region. Identify if more CDN’s are required, or if high value customers in specific parts of the world are having a negative experience with your site’s performance. Page-Level AJAX Calls For a specific page, see all the AJAX calls being made as well as the response time, throughput (rpm), total number of calls, error status codes, and average data transfer made for each one. Page View Throughput Throughput is measured in requests per per minute. Throughput metrics help you understand which pages are being called most frequently. Connect Browser with Backend Performance From the Page views report, you can select single page URL and see all of the associated backend APM transactions (if you have the APM Agent installed in your application). Quickly view the total call time, average response time, and call count for any individual backend transaction. You can also dive deeper into a particular transaction and see diagnostics within our APM reports. JavaScript Errors The JavaScript error dashboards help you identify production JavaScript errors impacting your users' experiences and begin pinpointing how to resolve them. JavaScript Error Summary This summary view gives you a high level understanding of the types of JavaScript errors happening, the frequency at which they occur, and the percentage of users affected by the errors. Errors by Browser For each type of error, this chart shows you which browsers are being impacted by the error and the relative contribution it is making to your total error volume. Percentage of Page Views with Errors For each type of error, this chart shows you the percentage of page views affected by it. This allows you to quickly assess the reach and impact a particular error has on your end users. Source Map Support Troubleshoot minified production JavaScript code, with source map support giving you full visibility to where in your code the front-end error is. Intuitive drag-and-drop lets you locate issues in a click, while API integrations work seamlessly with your build pipeline. Best-in-class Customer Experience Monitoring Crash analysis in New Relic Mobile lets you analyze the most impactful crashes and fix them faster. Source map support in New Relic Browser gives you more actionable visibility into front-end JS errors by showing you exactly where in the original source the error occurred, even if your code is minified. Browser Performance New Relic's Browser dashboards provide information about your end users' experience based on browser type and version, so you can understand where to focus your time testing and optimizing for performance. Browser Throughput Provides a snapshot of the average number of pageviews received per minute broken down by browser type. Browser Load Time - Segmentation Chart For each type of browser, a segmented view of time spent on request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Browser Version Chart Helps you understand which versions of each browser type your customers come from based on throughput. Error Instance Details Error Instance details grabs a snapshot of a single error and captures the stack trace details available from the browser, focusing on the actionable components, down to the line of code. These are metrics are combined with unique browser combinations down to the version level, and unique url. JavaScript diagnostics doesn't get more granular than this. AJAX If your applications use AJAX to update parts of a webpage after the initial page load, our AJAX dashboards will provide you with the level of visibility you need to understand how those requests are performing and ultimately affecting your users’ experience. AJAX Dashboard The main AJAX dashboard surfaces your site’s most resource intensive AJAX requests, filterable by time consumption, response time, throughput, callback time, and data transfer. From here you can drill into a particular call for detailed analysis. Calls by Page View Shows which page views are calling a particular server side controller, with page level detail around throughput, response time, total number of calls, and data transfer. Request Status Codes The status codes reporting indicates the return behavior from an AJAX call. A large number of non-200 status codes may indicate a problem with your AJAX endpoints. Data Transfer Per Request This shows data transfer which is requested and sent. Use this to look for correlations between high callback times and data transfer rates. Global Features The following features are used throughout New Relic’s product suite to help make our products easier to use and fit seamlessly into your existing workflows.

Filterable Geography Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region, down to the city level. Identify how a CDN or ASN/ Internet Service Provider is performing in different regions. Security New Relic is committed to helping customers make their applications fast and secure. We take protecting our customers' data seriously, here's an overview of how we do it. U.S. and EU Data Regions Our global data-hosting structure consists of two regions: European Union and United States. You can select your preferred data region during the account setup process, regardless of your physical location. (Note: We do not support migration or aggregation of data across regions.) SOC2 Audited New Relic has successfully completed a SOC 2 audit of processes and controls relevant to security and availability. This audit reviews our security process and controls and provides both ourselves, and more importantly our customers an independent, third-party assurance that we are taking the appropriate steps to protect our systems and our customer’s data. Secure Data Center The infrastructure that runs the New Relic service and stores our customer’s data resides in a Tier III, SSAE-16 certified data center. Customer data is backed up on a regular basis. Continuous Monitoring New Relic employs both internal and third-party services to perform continuous security scanning on both our network and applications to ensure that our applications and servers remain secure. Secure by Default We strongly believe in the concept of “secure by default”. Customers have to explicitly enable settings within New Relic to authorize the sending of sensitive data. We want to make sure that you are not accidentally exposing anything that you don’t want to. Compliance Friendly New Relic can be configured to operate securely in regulated environments such as PCI, HIPAA, or SOX. In addition we are Swiss and EU Privacy Shield certified.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your Amazon VPC data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported. Features The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that utilizes the scalable infrastructure of Amazon Web Services (AWS). With New Relic's VPC integration, you can gain visibility into configuration event changes that are overlaid across your Amazon services. The Amazon VPC integration generates a feed of configuration/inventory changes that occur in your VPC. VPC data is available in pre-built dashboards, and you can create custom queries and charts in New Relic One. You can also create alert conditions to notify you about changes in the VPC. Additionally, Enhanced Amazon VPC Flow Logs enables you to capture information about IP traffic to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Activate To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon VPC integration: Default New Relic polling interval: 15 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the VPC integration links. You can query and explore your data using the PrivateNetworkSample event type, with provider values of: VpcNatGateway VpcVpnTunnel By default, collection of VpcNatGateway, VpcVpnTunnel, and VpcVpnConnection data is disabled. This is because if you have many NAT gateways or many VPNs (connections and tunnels), it might lead to an increase on your CloudWatch bill. For this reason, the integration provides configuration settings to set whether you want to fetch that data. For more on how to use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data VPC NAT Gateway data This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcNatGateway: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC NAT Gateway Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description activeConnectionCount The total number of concurrent active TCP connections through the NAT gateway. bytesInFromDestination The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from the destination. bytesInFromSource The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. bytesOutToDestination The number of bytes sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. bytesOutToSource The number of bytes sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. connectionAttemptCount The number of connection attempts made through the NAT gateway. connectionEstablishedCount The number of connections established through the NAT gateway. errorPortAllocation The number of times the NAT gateway could not allocate a source port. idleTimeoutCount The number of connections that transitioned from the active state to the idle state. An active connection transitions to idle if it was not closed gracefully and there was no activity for the last 350 seconds. packetsDropCount The number of packets dropped by the NAT gateway. packetsInFromDestination The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from the destination. packetsInFromSource The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. packetsOutToDestination The number of packets sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. packetsOutToSource The number of packets sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. VPC VPN Tunnel This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcVpnTunnel: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC VPN Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description tunnelState The state of the tunnel. 0 indicates DOWN and 1 indicates UP. tunnelDataIn The bytes received through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes received after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes received during the period. tunnelDataOut The bytes sent through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes sent after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes sent during the period.

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "A glossary of common terminology you may encounter. account dropdown When you're logged into New Relic, the account dropdown menu displays your login name and is located at the top right of the UI. Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization. Create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Query your data more easily At the top of all UI pages, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the NRQL mode query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",
