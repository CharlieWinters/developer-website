Pages To view details of your New Relic apps, hosts, Synthetics monitors, Alerts, plugins, and key transactions, select a product from the main menu. The New Relic Android app includes: New Relic APM metrics, both real-time and historical data, including health maps. And, select the transaction icon for detailed transaction metrics, or an Overview Charts to view summary charts of your top five transactions. New Relic Infrastructure utilization. New Relic Plugins, including a list of their components or instances, and their charts and current values from the plugin's Summary. New Relic Mobile, including crash reports, network errors, API calls, and active user count. Select the filter icon to filter by labels and categories. Event notifications, including mobile alerts wherever you are, plus deployment notifications and notes. Note: New Relic's Android app does not have the full feature set of the New Relic web interface. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser. Time range When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame by using the time picker icon in the top right of the page (the 7D in the screenshot). This feature is similar to the standard New Relic time picker. Features include: Scrub the New Relic charts to move back and forth in the timeline. Select the time picker to choose a time range that ends now (from 30 minutes to 90 days ago). New Relic Synthetics You can use the Android app to view your New Relic Synthetics data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. Select the caret icon to view more detailed charts. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log. Alerts When you log in to your New Relic account from the Android app, your device is automatically associated with your user channel. Then, you can add your user channel to your target policy to receive alerts. For Android alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen and can be viewed by tapping the alert. You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all Critical events end. Mobile apps If you have a mobile application and have installed New Relic Mobile, you can monitor its performance directly from your Android device. New Relic Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Currently the patterns feature is opt-in; if you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, contact your account representative and ask to have it enabled. There will be up to a 24 hour lead time before the machine learning (ML) system generates a customized model for your account. Patterns will be available for all customers to enable or disable on demand at the end of April 2021. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore patterns and logs with no pattern By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs With No Pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs With No Pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Why don't I see Pattern data? The following are a few reasons why you might have Patterns enabled but not have any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, please contact support. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since Patterns was enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a \"message\" field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the \"message\" field of a log record. If your logs don't contain \"message,\" there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with, log patterns such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "Golden metrics and golden tags are bits of information about an entity that we consider to be the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic. You can see and contribute to the standard definitions of the golden metrics and tags in this public repository. This document explains how to query an entity's custom metrics using NerdGraph. Tip For more on how to query entities using the NerdGraph API, see our tutorial. Fetch golden metrics When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries are already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value. Here's an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with the GUID ExampleGUID. SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' TIMESERIES Copy You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example: { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenMetrics {   metrics { query title   } } } } } Copy Fetch golden tags Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by GUID or by entityType. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most important about the entity. { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenTags { tags { key } } } } } Copy Customize golden metrics and golden tags If you want to change the golden metrics and golden tags based on the specificities of your environment, you can override them in two different contexts, in your account, or in a workload. Override golden metrics or golden tags for a specific entity type in your whole account In this case, the new golden metrics or the new golden tags will be applied in all New Relic One, converting your new metrics and tags as the default for the specified entity type. To do that, you can use a NerdGraph mutation to override the golden metrics for a specific entity. mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account that you want to override. metrics: The new NRDB query will be shown as golden metrics. eventId: The field used to filter the entity in the metric. How the entity GUID is defined in your event. select: The SELECT clause of the NRDB query. This field is required. from: The FROM clause of the NRDB query. where: Complementary where clause to identify the entity type field. facet: The field to FACET. title: The title of the golden metric. This field is optional. name: The name of the golden metric. This field is required. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy The metrics input object defines the parts of an NRDB query, split into sections. One of these sections is the eventId, which is used to identify the field that defines the GUID inside the NRDB Event you want to use as a golden metric. For example: SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('EntityGuid') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' FACET entityName TIMESERIES Copy It's defined as follows: { eventId: \"entityGuid\", from: \"DatastoreSample\", where: \"provider='DynamoDbTable'\", facet: \"entityName\", select: \"average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)\", name: GetItem latency (ms), title: GetItem latency (ms) } Copy As you can see in the resultant object, the where clause only contains the provider field. The system adds the where clause with the eventId field by default. You can do the same for the golden tags using this NerdGraph mutation: mutation { entityGoldenTagsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, tags: [{key: \"applicationName\"} , {key: \"environment\"} ]) { errors { message type } tags { context { account } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Override golden metrics from a particular entity type in a workload New Relic's workloads provide an aggregated view of health and performance data about a group of entities. The time series charts shown for each entity type in a workload are defined by the golden metrics in the workload account. If you want to further customize which time series to show for a specific entity type in a particular workload, override the golden metrics in the account with the following mutation: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy See above for details on each field. In this case, context is the workload's GUID. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Fetch the custom golden metrics and golden tags The queries defined in the previous sections always return the default golden metrics and golden tags. If you want to fetch your custom golden metrics or golden tags, you need to send the context defined in the query, for example: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenMetrics( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { metrics { title query name } } } } } Copy For golden tags: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenTags(context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { tags { key } } } } } Copy You can send both contexts simultaneously for querying, if your metrics or tags have the context inside the workload. The API returns the most specific golden metric or golden tags based on the context that you defined in the requests. The priority is workload and account. Reset custom metrics and golden tags If your custom golden metrics are not relevant to you any more, you can restore the defaults defined by New Relic. In the context parameter, set the desired account or workload guid (in the guid parameter). To restore your golden metrics in an account, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account you want to reset. To restore your golden metrics in a workload, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: GUID_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy You can do the same for your custom golden tags: mutation { entityGoldenTagsReset( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}) { errors { message type } tags { key context { account guid } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Expected errors All these mutations can answer with the result of the operation or a list of errors. These are all the expected errors that you can receive: INVALID_CONTEXT: The context is not valid. There can only be one context, an account or a workload's GUID. If you use both, or use any other concept, or a GUID that doesn't belong to a workload, you will get this error. INVALID_DOMAIN_TYPE: The domain type is not valid. LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The maximum amount of metrics is 9. If you exceed this limit you will get this error. NOT_AUTHORIZED: The user doesn't have the permissions to carry out this action.",

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team.

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept. Basically, an entity is anything we monitor, including but not limited to: Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. Learn more about how we define \"entity.\" To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it can help to understand some important traits they have: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements You need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. OR Use the freeform query argument to provide your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to these examples, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation. Search by attribute Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')\"} Copy Search by entity GUID Use a specific entity's GUID to query deeper into its related data. For example: query($guids: EntityGuid! ) { actor { entities(guids: $guids) { entityType name } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section: {\"guids\": \"entity-guid-here\"} Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using the queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, you can rely on NerdGraph to help you build one, and then retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's Alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity.

The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them.

If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "When you acknowledge an incident, this indicates you're taking ownership of it. This is useful to let others who've received the notification know that you've taken responsibility for it. What \"acknowledge\" means Follow your organization's guidelines for what responsibilities you are agreeing to own when you acknowledge an incident. By acknowledging the incident, this simply flags your name and notifies others. Tip To provide a quick reference to your organization's standard operating procedures for handling an alert, you can include a runbook URL in the condition thresholds for the alert policy. The UI will include the runbook URL in Incidents pages and in email notifications as applicable. Only one person can acknowledge an incident. Once you acknowledge it, you can't undo it. If others try to acknowledge the same incident (for example, from their email notification), the incident's History page will appear, showing that the incident has been acknowledged. How to acknowledge incidents The user interface allows you to view incidents and acknowledge them, either from the Incidents index or from the selected incident itself. The Incidents page provides details about the incident history so you can more easily analyze the chain of events and their timeline throughout an incident. To acknowledge an incident from the user interface: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents or All incidents. From the selected incident row, check whether someone else's name or avatar already appears in the Acknowledge column. To find out the user's name, mouse over the avatar. To acknowledge the incident, yourself, select the Acknowledge icon. This automatically notifies everyone who has been set up to receive the notification. The UI also automatically adds your name (or avatar if applicable) to the incident's Acknowledge column. What happens to additional violations Your incident rollup preference determines whether and how Alerts will group the additional violations in the Incidents page. If you acknowledge an incident and new violations occur that roll up into the incident you just acknowledged, no further notifications will be sent out until the incident closes. Where to view your acknowledged incidents To view any incidents you have acknowledged: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. Optional: Use any available search or sort options to refine the index results (not available for the Acknowledge column). Select any row that shows your name or avatar to view the incident's history and details. What other options to acknowledge are available You can use additional methods (channels) to acknowledge notifications. For example: If your notification channel includes email, you can acknowledge the alert at the time you receive it by selecting the email's Acknowledge link. If you've registered and linked your iOS or Android mobile app to your account, you can add mobile as a notification channel in your policies. For example, Android users can then acknowledge an alert by using the notification bar. You don't need to open the New Relic app.",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Golden metrics and golden tags are bits of information about an entity that we consider to be the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic. You can see and contribute to the standard definitions of the golden metrics and tags in this public repository. This document explains how to query an entity's custom metrics using NerdGraph. Tip For more on how to query entities using the NerdGraph API, see our tutorial. Fetch golden metrics When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries are already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value. Here's an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with the GUID ExampleGUID. SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' TIMESERIES Copy You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example: { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenMetrics {   metrics { query title   } } } } } Copy Fetch golden tags Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by GUID or by entityType. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most important about the entity. { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenTags { tags { key } } } } } Copy Customize golden metrics and golden tags If you want to change the golden metrics and golden tags based on the specificities of your environment, you can override them in two different contexts, in your account, or in a workload. Override golden metrics or golden tags for a specific entity type in your whole account In this case, the new golden metrics or the new golden tags will be applied in all New Relic One, converting your new metrics and tags as the default for the specified entity type. To do that, you can use a NerdGraph mutation to override the golden metrics for a specific entity. mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account that you want to override. metrics: The new NRDB query will be shown as golden metrics. eventId: The field used to filter the entity in the metric. How the entity GUID is defined in your event. select: The SELECT clause of the NRDB query. This field is required. from: The FROM clause of the NRDB query. where: Complementary where clause to identify the entity type field. facet: The field to FACET. title: The title of the golden metric. This field is optional. name: The name of the golden metric. This field is required. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy The metrics input object defines the parts of an NRDB query, split into sections. One of these sections is the eventId, which is used to identify the field that defines the GUID inside the NRDB Event you want to use as a golden metric. For example: SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('EntityGuid') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' FACET entityName TIMESERIES Copy It's defined as follows: { eventId: \"entityGuid\", from: \"DatastoreSample\", where: \"provider='DynamoDbTable'\", facet: \"entityName\", select: \"average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)\", name: GetItem latency (ms), title: GetItem latency (ms) } Copy As you can see in the resultant object, the where clause only contains the provider field. The system adds the where clause with the eventId field by default. You can do the same for the golden tags using this NerdGraph mutation: mutation { entityGoldenTagsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, tags: [{key: \"applicationName\"} , {key: \"environment\"} ]) { errors { message type } tags { context { account } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Override golden metrics from a particular entity type in a workload New Relic's workloads provide an aggregated view of health and performance data about a group of entities. The time series charts shown for each entity type in a workload are defined by the golden metrics in the workload account. If you want to further customize which time series to show for a specific entity type in a particular workload, override the golden metrics in the account with the following mutation: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy See above for details on each field. In this case, context is the workload's GUID. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Fetch the custom golden metrics and golden tags The queries defined in the previous sections always return the default golden metrics and golden tags. If you want to fetch your custom golden metrics or golden tags, you need to send the context defined in the query, for example: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenMetrics( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { metrics { title query name } } } } } Copy For golden tags: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenTags(context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { tags { key } } } } } Copy You can send both contexts simultaneously for querying, if your metrics or tags have the context inside the workload. The API returns the most specific golden metric or golden tags based on the context that you defined in the requests. The priority is workload and account. Reset custom metrics and golden tags If your custom golden metrics are not relevant to you any more, you can restore the defaults defined by New Relic. In the context parameter, set the desired account or workload guid (in the guid parameter). To restore your golden metrics in an account, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account you want to reset. To restore your golden metrics in a workload, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: GUID_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy You can do the same for your custom golden tags: mutation { entityGoldenTagsReset( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}) { errors { message type } tags { key context { account guid } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Expected errors All these mutations can answer with the result of the operation or a list of errors. These are all the expected errors that you can receive: INVALID_CONTEXT: The context is not valid. There can only be one context, an account or a workload's GUID. If you use both, or use any other concept, or a GUID that doesn't belong to a workload, you will get this error. INVALID_DOMAIN_TYPE: The domain type is not valid. LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The maximum amount of metrics is 9. If you exceed this limit you will get this error. NOT_AUTHORIZED: The user doesn't have the permissions to carry out this action.",

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and error_beacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations.

Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API FedRAMP is not yet available for the Trace API itself, but note that some of our agents report trace data and you can enable FedRAMP for some of those agents.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic APM's PHP agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in New Relic APM, Browser, and Insights. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a PHP app with Docker. Important The New Relic PHP agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic PHP agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying a single PHP application via Debian. For best results with the GAE flex environment, always use Debian. For more information about deploying and configuring your PHP app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for PHP Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a PHP app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the New Relic PHP agent for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for PHP to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Extend the GAE image for PHP In this example, the Dockerfile extends the generic PHP image with application files for a single application in Debian. You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.

At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom runtime_config: document_root: . Copy 4. Build a Docker image The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. When building the Docker image, use the PHP image from Google App Engine. Standard Docker images from other providers may cause problems with GAE. To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5.

A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

With our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer you can execute and see the results of queries and mutations for Infinite Tracing configuration. This document explains some of the options that are available. Tip If you need help getting started with GraphQL, check out Introduction to New Relic NerdGraph. Update the random sampler on a trace observer As described in our docs on the tail-based sampling algorithms there are several ways Infinite Tracing chooses to sample a trace. The random sampler is configurable, allowing you to control the percent of traces kept. Tip If you need help about when it's appropriate to change the random filter, see Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter. The following example shows you how to update the value from the default of 1%: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Execute the following query to find the trace observer that contains the random sampler to modify: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { edge { tracing { traceObservers { id name providerRegion status traceFilters { randomTraceFilter { percentKept } } endpoints { agent { host } } } } } } } } Copy In the response, find the trace observer id. Here is an example where the value is 123456789: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"edge\": { \"tracing\": { \"traceObservers\": [ { \"endpoints\": [ { \"agent\": { \"host\": \"your-uuid-goes-here.aws-us-east-1.tracing.edge.nr-data.net\" } } ], \"id\": 123456789, \"name\": \"Production Workload, US-EAST-1\", \"providerRegion\": \"AWS_US_EAST_1\", \"status\": \"CREATED\", \"traceFilters\": { \"randomTraceFilter\": { \"percentKept\": 1 } } } ] } } } } } } Copy Execute a mutation using the id and the percent you want to keep. For example, to raise the value to 50% for the trace observer with id 123456789 that we found in the previous step, run the following: mutation { edgeUpdateTraceObservers( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID traceObserverConfigs: { id: 123456789, randomTraceFilterConfig: { percentKept: 50 } } ) { responses { errors { message type } traceObserver { traceFilters { randomTraceFilter { percentKept } } id endpoints { agent { host } } name status } } } } Copy Here's the response confirming the change: { \"data\":{ \"edgeUpdateTraceObservers\":{ \"responses\":[ { \"errors\":null, \"traceObserver\":{ \"endpoints\":[ { \"agent\":{ \"host\":\"your-uuid-goes-here.aws-us-east-1.tracing.edge.nr-data.net\" } } ], \"id\":123456789, \"name\":\"Production Workload, US-EAST-1\", \"status\":\"CREATED\", \"traceFilters\":{ \"randomTraceFilter\":{ \"percentKept\":50 } } } } ] } } } Copy Update the name on a trace observer Here's how you can change the name of a trace observer: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Find the trace observer whose name you'd like to update: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { edge { tracing { traceObservers { id name providerRegion status endpoints { agent { host } } } } } } } } Copy In the response, find the trace observer id that is returned: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"edge\": { \"tracing\": { \"traceObservers\": [ { \"endpoints\": [ { \"agent\": { \"host\": \"your-uuid-goes-here.aws-us-east-1.tracing.edge.nr-data.net\" } } ], \"id\": 123456789, \"name\": \"Production Workload, US-EAST-1\", \"providerRegion\": \"AWS_US_EAST_1\", \"status\": \"CREATED\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Execute a mutation that includes the new value for the name. For example, to change the name to Global Workload, US-EAST-1 for the trace observer with id 123456789, run the following: mutation { edgeUpdateTraceObservers( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID traceObserverConfigs: { id: 123456789, name: \"Global Workload, US-EAST-1\" } ) { responses { errors { message type } traceObserver { id endpoints { agent { host } } name status } } } } Copy Here's the response confirming the change: { \"data\":{ \"edgeUpdateTraceObservers\":{ \"responses\":[ { \"errors\":null, \"traceObserver\":{ \"endpoints\":[ { \"agent\":{ \"host\":\"your-uuid-goes-here.aws-us-east-1.tracing.edge.nr-data.net\" } } ], \"id\":123456789, \"name\":\"Global Workload, US-EAST-1\", \"status\":\"CREATED\" } } ] } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept. Basically, an entity is anything we monitor, including but not limited to: Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. Learn more about how we define \"entity.\" To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it can help to understand some important traits they have: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements You need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. OR Use the freeform query argument to provide your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to these examples, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation. Search by attribute Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')\"} Copy Search by entity GUID Use a specific entity's GUID to query deeper into its related data. For example: query($guids: EntityGuid! ) { actor { entities(guids: $guids) { entityType name } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section: {\"guids\": \"entity-guid-here\"} Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using the queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, you can rely on NerdGraph to help you build one, and then retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's Alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query.

If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy",

Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. List and filter policies The policiesSearch query allows you to paginate through all of your policies per account. It also allows some filtering functionality on the account policies. Listing all policies for an account Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { policiesSearch { policies { id name incidentPreference } } } } } } Copy Paginating through policies with cursor pagination In order to paginate through your policies, you must request the nextCursor field on your initial query. With cursor pagination, you continue to make a request through the result set until the nextCursor that is returned from the response comes back empty. This signifies that you reached the end of your results. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { policiesSearch { nextCursor policies { id name incidentPreference } totalCount } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"policiesSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"/8o0y2qiR54m6thkdgHgwg==:jZTXDFKbTkhKwvMx+CtsPVM=\", \"policies\": [ { \"id\": \"3455\", \"incidentPreference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"First Policy Name\" }, { \"id\": \"2123\", \"incidentPreference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Another Policy\" }, // ... more policies here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 745 } } } } } } Copy So, in your subsequent request, provide the cursor like so, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { policiesSearch(cursor: \"/8o0y2qiR54m6thkdgHgwg==:jZTXDFKbTkhKwvMx+CtsPVM=\") { nextCursor policies { id name incidentPreference } totalCount } } } } } Copy Find all policies by selected ids The API allows policy queries by a sub-select of ids. This will only return the information for these policies that you provide. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { policiesSearch(searchCriteria: { ids: [A_POLICY_ID, ANOTHER_POLICY_ID] }) { policies { id name incidentPreference } } } } } } Copy Find policy by id The API lets you query by policy id: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { policy(id: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { id name incidentPreference } } } } } Copy Create a policy In order to create a policy, supply a name and an incidentPreference. The incident preference will configure how incidents get created for each condition created in the policy. For more information, refer to the documentation about choosing your incident preference. mutation { alertsPolicyCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policy: { name: \"Your Policy Name\" incidentPreference: PER_CONDITION }) { id name incidentPreference } } Copy Update a policy When you update a policy, note that you don't need to supply all of the attributes on the policy. For example, you only need to supply the name if you only intend to update the name: mutation { alertsPolicyUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_POLICY_ID, policy: { name: \"Updated Policy Name\" }) { id name incidentPreference } } Copy Delete a policy You can delete policies via the NerdGraph API. Note that only the id may be requested back from a deleted resource: mutation { alertsPolicyDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "When you acknowledge an incident, this indicates you're taking ownership of it. This is useful to let others who've received the notification know that you've taken responsibility for it. What \"acknowledge\" means Follow your organization's guidelines for what responsibilities you are agreeing to own when you acknowledge an incident. By acknowledging the incident, this simply flags your name and notifies others. Tip To provide a quick reference to your organization's standard operating procedures for handling an alert, you can include a runbook URL in the condition thresholds for the alert policy. The UI will include the runbook URL in Incidents pages and in email notifications as applicable. Only one person can acknowledge an incident. Once you acknowledge it, you can't undo it. If others try to acknowledge the same incident (for example, from their email notification), the incident's History page will appear, showing that the incident has been acknowledged. How to acknowledge incidents The user interface allows you to view incidents and acknowledge them, either from the Incidents index or from the selected incident itself. The Incidents page provides details about the incident history so you can more easily analyze the chain of events and their timeline throughout an incident. To acknowledge an incident from the user interface: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents or All incidents. From the selected incident row, check whether someone else's name or avatar already appears in the Acknowledge column. To find out the user's name, mouse over the avatar. To acknowledge the incident, yourself, select the Acknowledge icon. This automatically notifies everyone who has been set up to receive the notification. The UI also automatically adds your name (or avatar if applicable) to the incident's Acknowledge column. What happens to additional violations Your incident rollup preference determines whether and how Alerts will group the additional violations in the Incidents page. If you acknowledge an incident and new violations occur that roll up into the incident you just acknowledged, no further notifications will be sent out until the incident closes. Where to view your acknowledged incidents To view any incidents you have acknowledged: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. Optional: Use any available search or sort options to refine the index results (not available for the Acknowledge column). Select any row that shows your name or avatar to view the incident's history and details. What other options to acknowledge are available You can use additional methods (channels) to acknowledge notifications. For example: If your notification channel includes email, you can acknowledge the alert at the time you receive it by selecting the email's Acknowledge link. If you've registered and linked your iOS or Android mobile app to your account, you can add mobile as a notification channel in your policies. For example, Android users can then acknowledge an alert by using the notification bar. You don't need to open the New Relic app.",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. View plugin dashboard details Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your Plugins menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central. The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards. To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name. Plugin summary Depending on the plugin, the summary includes: One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair) Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts Other information about alert violations, events, and activity If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features. If you want to... Do this... View version information for a component's or instance's agent Mouse over the component's name. Change the sort order On the title row of the plugin's summary page, select the up or down arrow for a component (instance) or a summary metric's label. Show or hide items on the events and activity list Select an event icon, or select All. View details about an event On the events and activity list, select the link. View page details for a component or instance Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance). Plugin dashboards Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard dashboard features to drill down into detailed information. The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update. Plugin alerts If the plugin publisher set Critical (red) or Caution (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can: Select and view alert details. Change the existing thresholds. Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for Critical events. Delete a plugin Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's Download or Continue button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources. Remove plugin components (instances) At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray. Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides. Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings icon for each component (instance). Delete the plugin After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your Plugins menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin. If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: New Relic APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents. Here's an example: <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy Code sample Here's a sample landing page you could modify to suit your needs: --- title: INSERT_YOUR_TITLE_HERE type: landingPage --- <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Aliquam auctor mattis nisl ut iaculis. * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Suspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod, a consectetur tortor vulputate. </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) to lectus diam, ornare vitae dui suscipit, laoreet ultrices lacus. * Mauris tempor massa ac augue mattis, nec pharetra quam mollis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) rhoncus tortor vitae libero laoreet feugiat. * Donec dui elit, fermentum vel faucibus sed, rhoncus in felis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) uspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod. * Pellentesque finibus magna vitae hendrerit gravida [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique. * Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Quisque hendrerit, dolor sed sodales aliquet. * Vestibulum varius lectus ac velit euismod [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> </LandingPageTileGrid> <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy",

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: New Relic APM: Monitor your web apps with New Relic APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. New Relic Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with New Relic Infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic Infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. New Relic Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with New Relic Synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy New Relic APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the Infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [Browser] ( /docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using New Relic APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in New Relic Dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build Dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Plugin summary metrics Each component or instance for your plugin in Plugin Central can have summary metrics, such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count. The summary metrics appear on your plugin's Summary page in the Plugins user interface. The summary metric dashboards are also useful as a debugging tool to review all of the metrics sent by your plugin agent to New Relic. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select any summary metric value for it. You can also change various plugin settings in the UI. When you first create a summary metric for your plugin, this triggers a change to New Relic's collectors. This may cause your running components (instances) to stop showing summary metrics for a short period of time. For example, if you add a new summary metric to your plugin, any components (instances) you are monitoring that use that plugin may have all summary metrics temporarily cleared. This will also close any outstanding related events and alerts. Depending on the components and other factors, you may need to wait fifteen minutes or more before summary metrics appear again. Add summary metrics To add a summary metric: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. From the Summary metrics section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. If your plugin contains only one summary metric, you can identify the metric in the chart's title and then hide the legend (colored bars that label the metrics) that normally appears below the chart. Also, if you define negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Optional: Add alert summary metrics Plugin publishers and users can define alert conditions from the plugin's Summary page by selecting the component's or instance's settings icon. The alerts will be activated when the summary metric's specified values fall above the thresholds. The Recent events list for the plugin's components (instances) appears on the plugin's Summary page. To view additional details about an alert, select its name. Sometimes there may be a delay between the time that a summary metric event is triggered and the time that New Relic creates the corresponding incident and sends the alert notification. There are several timing mechanisms at work, such as collector caching, summary metric event timing, delayed job queues, email delivery, etc. Depending on the situation, this delay could be up to ten or fifteen minutes before the alert notification is sent. Time periods for metrics Metrics that appear in dashboards are reported with a duration. The end time is implied by the time New Relic receives the metrics. This is why you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting. The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show various time periods. You can also deliver data at one-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, New Relic aggregates when there is too much data, but it does not extrapolate if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30-minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear. Recommendation: Use a 60-second polling interval. Default dashboards show 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Plugin dashboards You can create dashboards to visualize the data generated by your plugins in New Relic. You must be a plugin author or publisher to add, edit, and delete dashboards. Plugin users cannot customize the plugin dashboards they acquire from Plugin Central. View the default dashboard New plugins automatically include a default dashboard. Once your plugin agent starts sending data to New Relic's Plugin API, you can view the default dashboard in New Relic's UI and change it as needed. To view the default dashboard for your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select a component (instance). Add dashboards In addition to the default dashboard, you can create as many additional dashboards for your plugin as you want. After you publish your plugin, all of these dashboards and summary metrics are available to plugin users. The customized dashboards that display plugin data are part of the plugin. Plugin users cannot add their own dashboards. This needs to be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin fork or update. To create additional dashboards: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. From the Dashboards section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. Specify a title for your dashboard, select a page layout, then select Create. From the new dashboard page, type a label for the new chart or table, and then select Add chart or table. Edit the chart, including the case-sensitive metrics (for example, a metric name you see in the agent output, such as Component/SIN[Value]) and value (for example, Total value). To use additional options (for example, number format), select Advanced options. Optional: Use a wildcard (*) to show multiple metrics on a chart. For example, to include the metric component/foo/bar and the metric component/foo/xyz, use the metric name component/foo/*.f Select Save and Preview to preview the chart or table. Or, select Save and finish when you are satisfied with the appearance of the chart or table. Review the new chart that appears on the customized dashboard, and continue adding, editing, or rearranging charts and tables on your dashboard as needed. When finished, select I'm done editing. Avoid metric grouping problems Wildcards provide flexibility for how your metric names appear. When creating a chart, consider whether you want the metric names to appear with identical namespace segments, or include a wildcard to strip the namespace segments. For example: Component/Database/Metric1 Component/Database/Metric2 Component/Database/Metric3 Copy OR Metric1 Metric2 Metric3 Copy To prevent problems with metric grouping issues, avoid defining values that result in excessively large numbers. For example, if a plugin's chart value is 1 widget and New Relic collects 3 million widgets, change the value to 1 million widgets so that the chart can show millions of widgets more efficiently. Also, avoid creating high-precision values containing many digits after a decimal point. Change or delete dashboards To update or remove any plugin dashboard, including the default: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. Keep a stable production version of your plugin that users can acquire from Plugin Central, and create a development version that you are actively improving, testing, browsing the presentation of metrics on your custom dashboard, or otherwise have in a non-production state. Plugin settings You can change several plugin settings before you publish the plugin. You can also make changes at any time to published plugins. Initial settings Before you publish your plugin, you can: Select a generic plugin icon for the Plugins UI. This is not the same as the URL for your customized branding image you may choose as part of the publishing process. Change your plugin's label for the Plugins UI. By default, this is the first 11 characters of the plugin's Title field. Change your plugin's title. The default title is your plugin's GUID. Add, change, or delete your plugin's summary metrics and their alert conditions. Add, change, or delete your plugin's dashboards. Exception: You can edit but you cannnot delete your plugin's default dashboard. To add, change, or delete plugin settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. When finished, be sure to save your changes. Additional updates After you publish your plugin, you can continue making changes. Recommendation: To avoid development and testing impacts on your users, maintain development and production versions. To make additional updates to your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From your plugin's Summary page, select Edit, Publish, or your component's (instance's) settings icon as applicable. Update the settings as needed, and then save your changes. When you are ready to release this version: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, select your plugin, and then select Publish. Here is a summary of where to view or make changes to your plugin. Type of change Edit Publish Settings Agent: Change the plugin's version (n/a in UI). Alert conditions, customized for components (instances) Alert conditions, defaults for summary metrics Branding image (URL) that appears in Plugin Central Components (instances): Remove from your plugin Dashboards: Add, edit, delete Description Developer Terms of Service Icon that appears in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (label) in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (title) in Plugin Central NPI Compatible designation Publisher's name Summary metrics: Add, edit, delete URL for installation and setup instructions URL for your support site URL for your website (\"About us\")",

URI Metric timeslice data is sent with the Plugin API as an HTTP POST of JSON data using this URI: https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics Copy The Plugin API does not support New Relic's REST API, and vice versa. However, you can use the REST API (v2) to extract plugin data. For a list with links to procedures and examples, see Plugin examples (v2). GUID The plugin needs a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), which is a character string limited to no less than 4 and no more than 255 characters. The GUID for a published plugin must be unique for each plugin. When creating a plugin, you are responsible for managing your own GUIDs to avoid naming conflicts.

Thus, you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection.

Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Metric data details The JSON data is a hash with two required keys at the top level: components: An array of components, each consisting of a hash of attributes for the individual component, including the metric data. agent: A hash describing the agent that is reporting metrics data to New Relic Plugins on behalf of the component(s). Of these values, only host and version are required. When graphing metrics, be aware that null = zero. Metric data POST Description Component data One of two required keys at the top level. This is an array of hashes describing the components that report metrics in this request. Each hash contains the following values: name A name ( < =32 characters) that uniquely identifies the monitored entity and appears as the display name for this agent. Note: Metric names are case sensitive. guid A \"reverse domain name\" styled identifier; for example, com.newrelic.mysql. This is a unique identity defined in the plugin's user interface, which ties the agent data to the corresponding plugin user interface in New Relic. duration The duration in seconds over which the metric data was collected. The end time is implied as the time the data is received by the API. metrics Timeslice data for each metric being reported. The hash keys are metric names, and the values are the timeslice data value for the named metric. Agent data One of two required keys at the top level. A hash specifying information about the agent that is reporting data on behalf of the components. host (required) The hostname of the agent monitoring the specified components. This is the hostname where the monitoring agent is running, not the hostname of the component being monitored. pid (optional) The process identifier of the agent monitoring the specified components. This is the process identifier of the monitoring agent itself, not a process identifier that may be associated with the monitored components. version (required) The version of the agent monitoring the specified components, using the format A.B.C where A, B, and C are integers. The version number must conform to the rules specified in standard Semantic Versioning scheme v2.0.0. Timeslice metric values Metrics are sent inside the component hash with the key metrics and a hash as a value. The hash keys are metric names, and the values are the timeslice data values for the named metric. The timeslice hash value uses one of three formats: Timeslice hash value Description A single scalar value with a floating point number or integer This is the simplest format, and this number is required. The reported value is used as the total, minimum, and maximum data value. The count value is assumed to be 1. The Plugin API does not support reporting of arbitrary string metrics, only scalar values that are aggregated. Array of five required values in specific order An array of five required integers or floating point numbers that represent, in order: Total value over the time period Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count Minimum value over the time period Maximum value over the time period Sum of squares for the samples over the time period Hash with five required key/value pairs in any order A hash with value names as the keys, and integers or floating point values as the values. All five key/value pairs are required. The keys of the hash are the type of timeslice data, and the value is the data value. These has key/value pairs can be in any order: total: Total value over the time period count: Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count min: Minimum value over the time period max: Maximum value over the time period sum_of_squares: Sum of squares for the samples over the time period Calculations Limited mathematical calculations are available with the key/value pairs, such as computing total, count, minimum, maximum, averages, and standard deviations. However, to do more extensive calculations, you need to do the math in the agent, and then send the results as a new metric. For example, send Metric1, Metric2, and Metric3 (which equals Metric1 divided by Metric2). If you submit negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Examples Here are some examples. Metrics \"metrics\" : { \"Component/Database/Primary[Queries/Second]\" : { \"total\" : 25, \"count\" : 2, \"min\" : 10, \"max\" : 15, \"sum_of_squares\" : 325 }, \"Component/Database/Secondary[Queries/Second]\" : [25, 2, 10, 15, 325], \"Component/Database/Backup[Queries/Second]\" : 10 } Copy cURL example curl -vi https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics \\ -H \"X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\ -X POST -d '{ \"agent\": { \"host\" : \"db.internal.your_company.com\", \"pid\" : 1234, \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" }, \"components\": [ { \"name\": \"Primary MySQL Database\", \"guid\": \"com.your_company_name.plugin_name\", \"duration\" : 60, \"metrics\" : { \"Component/ProductionDatabase[Queries/Second]\": 100, \"Component/AnalyticsDatabase[Queries/Second]\": { \"min\" : 2, \"max\" : 10, \"total\": 12, \"count\" : 2, \"sum_of_squares\" : 104 } } } ] }' Copy Metric references Refer to these references as you develop your own plugins. Metric naming guidelines Metric timeslice data uses a unique case-sensitive identifier, referred to as the metric name. In order for the metric to be rendered usefully in the user interface, the metric name must contain a prefix, category name, label, and optional units indicator. Here are some recommended guidelines for the text in metric names to make them more readable in the user interface. Metric naming guidelines Guidelines UI display Use case and whitespace characters appropriate for display in the user interface, because segments are rendered as-is in the UI. Category and label segments Metric names are case sensitive. Capitalize the first word in the category and label segments. Keep category and label segments as short as possible. Length There is a limit of 255 characters for metric names. Characters to avoid using Avoid using the following characters in names. These characters have special meaning and should not be used except where specifically required for their purpose. / ] [ | * Also avoid multi-byte characters. Units Use abbreviated names for units when possible. Metric segments Each of these segments is divided by the forward slash / character. Each segment is interpreted for a specific purpose in the UI and roughly follows this pattern: prefix/category/label[units] Copy For example, the metric representing the latency of cache hits reported by a plugin collecting data for a cache appliance might look like this: Component/Cache/Hits[sec|hit] Copy Metric segment order Notes Prefix: Component/ or Custom/ The first segment of a custom metric is Component/ (if it comes from a plugin agent) or Custom/ (if it is a custom metric collected by a New Relic agent. For example, Custom/MyMetric). Caution If you use the Plugin API only, and if the metrics do not start with Component/, they may not be available or may not appear correctly in charts and dashboards. Category name The second part of a custom metric is a category name, used to group metrics into different categories. For example, the metrics reported by a database plugin may fall into categories such as schema, tables, or connections. Label The third part of the metric name is used for labeling the data when it appears in tables and charts. If it contains multiple segments, each slash separating the segments of the label will be rendered as part of the label. Units The fourth segment of the metric consists of a units specification. Metric attributes Most metrics are defined statically and represent some global state; for example, cache size. Other metrics are dynamic and include some contextual attribute like the name of a host or a file. These metrics need to be structured so you can easily show them as a group in a table stacked in a chart. To add attribute names to a metric, put them in trailing segments separated by a forward slash / character. For example: Component/Disk/Bytes In/dev001 Component/Network/External services/ae592c3.aws.com Copy You can specify more than one attribute as long as they occupy the same position for a given metric category and label: Component/Tables/Row count/DB001/BLOG_POSTS[rows] Copy Caution Avoid overloading the metric space by putting in segment values that have a large range of values. While something like a customer's region in an attribute is a reasonable thing to track in the metric, the customer name would not be if you have more than a few hundred customers. If your agent starts sending an excessive amount of metrics, your metrics may be automatically collapsed into groups with wildcards: Component/Users/*[visits] Copy Metric values You can report a metric value in one of two ways: Single value: This typically is the value being reported for that time slice. If you use an SDK, you report the single value to the SDK. It handles tracking the rest of these values. Set of aggregate value: This includes the min, max, and sum of squares values for the value being reported. If you use the Plugin API, the preferred method is to report all of the values. When aggregating a series of timeslice data into a single timeslice data entry for a given period, all fields are summed except for the min and max value. If you are using an SDK plugins, this is done automatically. If you are using the Plugin API to develop plugins, you need to code for this. A metric value contains several fields, but it is represented primarily by the count and value. The count is a 32-bit integer field, and the value is a 32-bit float. Metric values can represent more than one data point or sample as an aggregation of measures. Typically the count is the number of samples, and the value is the total value of all samples. Here are the fields in a metric value: Metric value Description count The number of things being measured. If data is collected at the time the event occurs, like with some kind of injection, then the count in the timeslice data will be 1. Required if it is not 1 (0 generally represents an absent value). value Required: The total value measured across all things being counted. When averages are calculated later, we divide the value by the count. In some cases, the value field is irrelevant. min, max The minimum and maximum values when the count is greater than 1. When the count is 1, these are the same as the value. Optional depending on whether they are available or relevant for a given metric. sum of squares This is the sum of squares of each value and is useful when the values follow a standard distribution. You can only capture this value when you are collecting data each time the event happens. You store the value of the event in the value field and the square of the value in the sum of squares. This is used to calculate a standard deviation later on. The sum of squares is optional. It is used to calculate a standard deviation for a selection of data. If standard deviation for the value is not meaningful, such as when the values are not part of a normal distribution, then the sum of squares is omitted. Units When a metric value is collected by periodically sampling an interface, the count units are implicitly samples, and the value units are whatever is being sampled. For data it might be bytes. For throughput it might be something like kilobytes/second. For utilization (like CPU) it might be percent. When the count units are samples, they can be omitted in the metric name. Units of time, bytes, and bits may get special treatment, allowing additional conversion in the user interface between magnitudes. For example, if you specify a metric with units of kilobytes, then in the UI you may be presented the option of displaying a chart of Mb. Metrics units describe what the value field and count represent. Units are specified inside brackets and consist of units for the value, followed by a pipe (|) and then the units for the count. For example: Component/metric_id[value_unit|count_unit] Copy Exception: The pipe and count units (|[count_unit]) are not required after the value unit for samples. Rate metrics are commonly defined as sample per interval. This is defined as units/interval in the metric, with a forward slash to separate units from interval. For example: Component/metric_id[value_unit/interval] Copy In rare cases there will only be a unit value for count. The value will be interpreted as unitless. Value units are omitted, and the vertical bar appears in front of the count units. For example: Component/metric_id[|count_unit] Copy Units for plugin metrics Notes Naming conventions You can have mixed-case unit names. They.can consist strictly of alphabetical characters as well as the _, %, or / symbols. Case is preserved. Punctuation markers, dashes, spaces and any other symbols are not allowed. Recommendation: Use uncapitalized words, spelled out in full. For example, use second not sec. Rate metrics When a metric value represents a rate, such as bytes/second, then the value is assumed to be a sample for the given interval. The units specifier looks like [ bytes/second] since the count units are implicitly samples. For example: Component/metric_id[bytes/second] Copy The count units are samples (default) and the value units are bytes/second. The forward slash separates the units from the interval. Count with units A common case for declaring units is when measuring response times. If the custom metric represents the average latency of a call to a cache, then the units for the metric value are seconds per call. For example: Component/metric_id[seconds|call] Copy Count units are calls and value units are seconds. The default count metric is not being used, so you need to specify it. The bar separates the value units from the count units. Units in charts The units specified in a metric have several implications for the way the values are interpreted by generic charts and tables: Units display in labels and tooltips in charts to indicate what the values represent. Units imply a set of different values available from a single metric value. When creating a chart in a dashboard, the dashboard author selects one of the available value methods for that metric to plot in the chart.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "To run our Kubernetes installation for Windows, follow the steps below to: Check the compatibility and requirements. Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the chart builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "After you set up Incident Intelligence, our system will begin finding issues from your data sources. In the issue feed, you can find an overview of all your issues, along with helpful information about them. You can also click any individual issue for more detail, including its analysis summary, event log, and details about correlated issues. This screenshot shows an example issue feed, which describes your issues' statuses, correlations, and more. What's the difference between an issue, incident, and event? In short, these terms are like building blocks. Events are raw data from your sources. Incidents are made up of one or more events. Issues are composed of one or more incidents. In more detail: Events indicate a state change or trigger defined by your monitoring systems. An event contains information about the affected entity, and they are almost always triggered automatically by the system. Incidents are groups of events that describe the \"symptoms\" of your system over time. These symptoms are detected by your monitoring tools, which evaluate your data streams and events. Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. Visual timeline The visual timeline, as presented below, shows you a breakdown of: Incidents The trends taking place What incidents are active What incidents are resolved What is correlated to each other Various milestones at different issue levels In addition, you’ll see a grey line at the top of the timeline. In comparison to the visual timeline that shows the changes to each incident, the grey line represents changes to the issue. Mouse over the grey line to see details of the event. Finally, mouse over the incident to see information on the location, timing, and level of importance of a specific incident. This figure shows a particular incident populated on January 11th with a level of Critical. To view the issues in a text format, in the right hand corner, click Switch to issue log view. Related activity The related activity section aggregates a set of incidents into a single issue, according to a rule-based system. This section will show you the Last Update, the Source location, its State, the number of Related Events, and where it Originated. You can also copy the Payload or click on Analyze for more information. Issue summary The issue page is built to first provide the user with bottom line insights to understand the problem and minimize the time needed to resolve it. The following outlines each of the four sections on the issue page: The Analysis Summary: the analysis summary has two machine learning modules, the golden signals and the related components. The Suggested Responder: the suggested responder will tell you who to potentially reach out to on your team to solve a specific problem. The Impacted Entities: an entity is anything that has data you can monitor. Specifically, these are focused on incidents from New Relic sources, extracting the entities and providing a summary. Each entity is unique. The Label Sets: label sets are focused on incidents that come from 3rd party sources, such as PagerDuty, AWS Cloudwatch, REST APIs, etc., as well as for NRQL queries. They come in the form of key:value pairs. All four of these sections can show up together for each issue or separately. It will vary based on the data in the issue. In addition to these four sections, you can also take a look at anomaly overview and entity overview directly from the issue feed. If you hover over an impacted entity application, you’ll notice both call to actions: anomaly overview and entity overview. Anomaly overview will open the application's anomalies page. This is only available for applications that are set up for Proactive Detection. Finally, the issue page contains deployment events. APM’s Deployment page lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. This section will only show up if New Relic has identified applications under the Impacted Entities that have deployments. There are two types of deployment events: deployments and related deployments. Click “Show all deployments”, to see all your deployment events when they arrive. Click a specific deployment to see its APM deployments page. Root cause analysis Root cause analysis automatically finds potential causes for an issue and its impacted entities. It shows you why open issues occurred, which deployments contributed, and relevant error logs and attributes. With this, you can investigate the problem and reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR). Tip Note that root cause analysis is dependent on other New Relic data sources and features. This is why root cause analysis information may not always be present for every issue. When you select an issue, you may see Root cause analysis information. Root cause analysis includes three main UI sections: Deployment events: When you set up deployments, we provide the deployment nearest to the issue creation. Changes, such as deployments, account for a high percentage of the root causes of incidents and having that information at hand can help diagnose and resolve issues. Error logs: You can explore millions of log messages with a single click and use manual querying to help you find anomalous patterns and hard-to-find problems. Attributes to investigate: We scan the distribution of attributes and surface possible causes by finding significant changes in the distribution. For example, for every single transaction event, we can scan to see if an individual user starts to take up an anomalous share of the requests sent to your app. You can also query interesting attributes. Use decisions To further reduce noise or get improved incident correlation, you can change or customize your decisions. Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence groups incidents together. To get started, see Decisions. Use suggested responders If you’re using PagerDuty or New Relic alerts violations as your incident notification tools, Incident Intelligence suggests relevant team members that can help resolve your issues. Incident Intelligence learns from your PagerDuty and alerts violations data to provide suggestions for each new incident. Once you receive a suggestion, you can contact the responder or search for relevant documentation that person may have written. To get started, enable PagerDuty or alerts violations as a source for Incident Intelligence. Afterwards, you can view the suggestions in two places: The issue feed, where you can also provide feedback on the suggestions. Directly within PagerDuty (both UI and API.) If you’re also using PagerDuty as a destination, the suggestions will appear in your issue notifications payload. Important This feature doesn't account for on-call availability at the time of incident. Tip In order to train the model, we use the information PagerDuty provides about individuals. We ingest incident information only, not users’ contact details.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload.

When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Tip To use workloads and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Easily access your insert and query API keys by going to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data> API Keys Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. View plugin dashboard details Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your Plugins menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central. The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards. To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name. Plugin summary Depending on the plugin, the summary includes: One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair) Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts Other information about alert violations, events, and activity If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features. If you want to... Do this... View version information for a component's or instance's agent Mouse over the component's name. Change the sort order On the title row of the plugin's summary page, select the up or down arrow for a component (instance) or a summary metric's label. Show or hide items on the events and activity list Select an event icon, or select All. View details about an event On the events and activity list, select the link. View page details for a component or instance Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance). Plugin dashboards Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard dashboard features to drill down into detailed information. The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update. Plugin alerts If the plugin publisher set Critical (red) or Caution (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can: Select and view alert details. Change the existing thresholds. Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for Critical events. Delete a plugin Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's Download or Continue button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources. Remove plugin components (instances) At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray. Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides. Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings icon for each component (instance). Delete the plugin After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your Plugins menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin. If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to support.newrelic.com.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the New Relic Explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload.

Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs.

This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Migrate users to the new account/user model In April of 2021, we began allowing some New Relic organizations to migrate their original user model users to the newer New Relic One user model. This new user model offers many benefits in simplifying and improving how you manage your users' roles and access to accounts. To learn how to find out if you qualify for this and how to start, see Migrate users. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorer's Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard pricing tier includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users.

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Project Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list service.usage.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "New Relic offers an integration for reporting your AWS X-Ray data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported. Activate the integration To enable the AWS X-Ray integration, follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to Infrastructure. When you've successfully connected your AWS account with New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, and then click AWS. Click Manage Services to select the AWS integration you want to activate. Check the checkbox next to AWS X-Ray. Click Save. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter your data using configuration options. Here's the default polling information for the AWS X-Ray integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Tip Please allow up to 20 minutes for your first traces to appear. Since traces are collected after they complete, and only once per polling interval, the X-Ray trace data lags real-time considerably, and should not be used for alerting. Important Polling intervals longer than 5 minutes may result in lost traces. New Relic drops trace data more than 20 minutes old. Similarly, long-running traces are likely to be incomplete. New Relic's X-Ray Monitoring will collect completed traces only, and spans within a trace older than 20 minutes are dropped. Find and use data New Relic maps X-Ray segments into span events. Once you've activated this integration, you should see AWS X-Ray traces appearing in distributed tracing. To filter your spans, you can use the newRelic.ingestPoint attribute. This attribute is set to xray.polling for all X-Ray spans. Using custom IAM policies If you're using a custom IAM policy when connecting your AWS account with New Relic Infrastructure, your custom policy will need the following permissions for the AWS X-Ray integration to work: xray:BatchGet* xray:Get* X-Ray and Lambda Functions Lambda functions require some configuration to use X-Ray. See the Using AWS X-Ray section in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. In particular, note that the execution role for your Lambda function will need additional permissions to record data to X-Ray. X-Ray and Step Functions AWS Step Function state machines are distributed applications, and can be monitored with X-Ray. X-Ray tracing needs to be explicitly enabled for X-Ray to capture data for step function state machines. Be sure to enable X-Ray tracing for any lambda functions in your state machine as well as for the state machine overall.",

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you. There are two data explorer tabs available: Events and Metrics. This document explains details about Events. For information on the Metrics tab, see Metrics data explorer. Events vs metrics In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer page has two tabs: Events: In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to any data that can be queried via NRQL. This includes all our major data types, including events and the Metric, Log, and Span data types. Metrics: In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to metric timeslice data. (Note that metric timeslice data is available for querying with NRQL in New Relic One.) For an improved querying and charting experience, we recommend using New Relic One chart builder and dashboards. UI components Use the Events data explorer to view and explore the data available to you. The UI includes: A dropdown that lets you select a data type, like PageView or Transaction. A time-based chart for that data. A sample of that data type, showing its attached attributes, and the ability to see other samples. Ability to search by group by and search for specific attributes. Data samples The most recent sample for the chosen data type is listed at the bottom of the page. Default attributes are underlined. To see more samples, select See more samples. You may need to scroll left and right to see the full table of data. Caution The amount of data stored for a given event type can run into the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of records. This report only shows a small sample. Use this UI to review the structure of the data, not the contents of a specific record. For example, you can use it to make sure an attribute is populating properly.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...)

Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); Copy To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Copy Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); Copy To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Copy Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Copy Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) Copy The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) Copy With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights Caution The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Copy Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) Copy NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Copy Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); Copy boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); Copy IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); Copy public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) Copy If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); Copy RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Copy Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Copy Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Copy Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes Caution These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Used to instrument functions, methods, generators, and coroutines that aren't instrumented by default. Description function_trace is a decorator for adding to functions, methods, generators, and coroutines. Adding this decorator lets you collect additional transaction information (including transaction trace information). (An alternate way to instrument functions without having to touch your app code is to list them in the config file.) function_trace does not give you a full profile of all the functions that happen in a decorated function. What it does is add the decorated function as a node in the New Relic UI and capture the time spent in that function. If you need more detail about what is going on in that function, you would need to also apply the function trace to the function's child functions. The function_trace decorator can be used on generators and coroutines with agent version 2.102.0.85 or higher. Timing of these objects begins when consumption starts, and ends when the object is exhausted or goes out of scope. This is a change from earlier versions where the metric represented the time taken to create the generator or coroutine object itself. You can use the decorator in conjunction with existing decorators, including those for static and class methods. When nesting multiple decorators, have the function_trace decorator as the outermost decorator. Important For any decorators that are being wrapped, use functools.wraps() from the Python standard library in their implementation. (Or, otherwise ensure that the decorator propagates the correct name attributes of the innermost wrapped object required to allow correct name introspection.) If this is not done, then when the metric is reported, the name of the nested decorator function (not the innermost wrapped function) will be used. Alternate call forms For setups where you cannot use the decorator, these alternate call forms are available: The context manager The FunctionTrace context manager is used when the parameters to be passed cannot be determined before runtime. (For example, you may not know the name of a function at import time.) When using the context manager to name a metric, you must always supply the name and the metric path prefix. The FunctionTrace class implements the context manager and is used in conjunction with the with statement. The FunctionTrace class is the lowest level primitive available for tracing time against a transaction. The with statement defines the bounds of what is timed and not a single function. Thus, the context manager could be applied to an arbitrary block of code. The block of code could therefore contain calls to multiple functions, or it could be a self-contained block of code implementing a time-oriented algorithm that you want to track. Important Avoid tracing blocks of code that are called an excessive number of times. For example, do not use it within the context of a loop that executes many times. The data generated will incur a performance overhead. A better solution is to enclose the loop. The wrapper If you know in advance where the specific functions you want to trace are, you could use the function_trace decorator. However, if you don't know all the functions that need to be traced (for example, if they're being looked up dynamically as part of a routing system), then you must use the FunctionTraceWrapper to wrap the function at the time of registration or at the time of calling. Path-based wrapping wrap_function_trace is used for wrapping functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example: you might use this to instrument library code that you don't want to modify. For more about the differences between these call formats, see Different call formats. Parameters Parameters for decorator newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy This call includes these parameters: Parameter Description name string Optional. The function name. If not set, defaults to the captured name of the function. group string Optional. The group represents the naming structure for the name parameter. This is used in the UI for segregating the transaction types. If not supplied, the group will default to Function in expectation that the name is of the form module:class.function or module:function and represents the name of the function being executed. If you are creating a custom group, it's recommended you prefix it with Python/. label string Optional. Adds a callout-style flag to the segment in a transaction trace. Default is None. params dict Optional. Custom parameters to add to the segment in transaction traces. terminal boolean Optional. If true, no children segments will be recorded. Default is False. Parameters for context manager newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace(name, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the context manager includes all of the parameters from function_trace. The name parameter is required and not optional. Parameter Description name string Required. The function name. Wrapper parameters newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(wrapped, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the wrapper include all parameters for function_trace and a wrapped parameter: Parameter Description wrapped function Required. The function being wrapped. Path-based wrapping parameters newrelic.agent.wrap_function_trace(module, object_path, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters include all parameters for function_trace and these parameters: Parameter Description module object Required. The module containing the function to be instrumented. object_path string The path to the location of the function. Examples function_trace example An example of using the function_trace decorator: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy An example of using the function_trace decorator with native coroutines: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy Context manager example An example of using the FunctionTrace context manager: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) with newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace( endpoint, 'Python/EndPoint'): return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy Wrapper example An example of using the FunctionTraceWrapper: URL routing with Werkzeug yields a name that is used first to dynamically look up a method of a class using getattr() and the result then invoked: def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() return getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint)(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to trace the endpoint function, you can rewrite this as: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(function) return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to name the metric after the endpoint name (rather than naming the metric based on the identifier for the function being called), you can supply the name to use plus an alternate metric path prefix when the FunctionTraceWrapper object is created. import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper( function, name=endpoint, group='Python/EndPoint') return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy For this example, if the endpoint were called help, the final metric would be: Python/EndPoint/help Copy In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category would be Python and the segment name EndPoint/help. That segment name would also appear in slow transaction traces as the node name.",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Copy Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Copy Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Copy Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } Copy List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Copy Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account using CloudWatch Metric Streams This mutation links an Amazon AWS account sending data through CloudWatch Metric Streams to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN>, metricCollectionMode: PUSH }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Copy Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. Caution This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Copy Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trend s, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both. When your data escapes the predicted \"normal\" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification. Set baseline thresholds one.newrelic.com > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition: Baseline alert conditions give you the ability to set intelligent, self-adjusting thresholds that only generate violations when abnormal behavior is detected. To create a baseline condition: When you start to create a condition, choose one of the following data sources: APM: Application metric baseline Browser: Metric baseline NRQL (and then choose a baseline type threshold) Here are some tips for setting baseline thresholds: Set the baseline direction to monitor violations that happen either above or below the baseline. Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in the stream of data coming into New Relic. The stream of data that comes into New Relic is called a signal. You can control what part of the signal is alerted on through NRQL conditions. These NRQL condition alerts are processed by the streaming algorithm. The NRQL query provides the signal filter for all of your incoming data. Tip You can read more about the streaming alerts platform in this Explorers Hub post. Why it matters Alerts violations are easy when they're caused by a specific event happening, but trickier when looking for events not happening. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional offset delay allows for slower data to come through before it's processed. Once the aggregation window plus the offset time have elapsed, New Relic groups the aggregated data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation isn't triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools you can use to more effectively alert on your streaming data, giving you greater control and reducing the number of false alerts notifications. They are: Loss of signal detection Gap filling Aggregation window duration customization Offset evaluation Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Aggregation window In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before using the aggregation function to evaluate the data. A longer aggregation window gives straggling data points more time to arrive before evaluating that data. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 1 second and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Offset evaluation For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. The offset time value is the number of aggregation windows you want to use. The duration for each window is set in the Aggregation window field. For example, if your aggregation window is 1 minute and your Offset evaluation is 3, then a straggling data point will have about 3 minutes to arrive before it might be dropped. In other words, streaming alerts will always keep 3 aggregation windows in the queue, waiting 1 minute before evaluating each window and adding a new one. The current default is 3.",

Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic chart builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName. Get logs on sending events To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events infra-agent Copy",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "After you set up Incident Intelligence, our system will begin finding issues from your data sources. In the issue feed, you can find an overview of all your issues, along with helpful information about them. You can also click any individual issue for more detail, including its analysis summary, event log, and details about correlated issues. This screenshot shows an example issue feed, which describes your issues' statuses, correlations, and more. What's the difference between an issue, incident, and event? In short, these terms are like building blocks. Events are raw data from your sources. Incidents are made up of one or more events. Issues are composed of one or more incidents. In more detail: Events indicate a state change or trigger defined by your monitoring systems. An event contains information about the affected entity, and they are almost always triggered automatically by the system. Incidents are groups of events that describe the \"symptoms\" of your system over time. These symptoms are detected by your monitoring tools, which evaluate your data streams and events. Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. Visual timeline The visual timeline, as presented below, shows you a breakdown of: Incidents The trends taking place What incidents are active What incidents are resolved What is correlated to each other Various milestones at different issue levels In addition, you’ll see a grey line at the top of the timeline. In comparison to the visual timeline that shows the changes to each incident, the grey line represents changes to the issue. Mouse over the grey line to see details of the event. Finally, mouse over the incident to see information on the location, timing, and level of importance of a specific incident. This figure shows a particular incident populated on January 11th with a level of Critical. To view the issues in a text format, in the right hand corner, click Switch to issue log view. Related activity The related activity section aggregates a set of incidents into a single issue, according to a rule-based system. This section will show you the Last Update, the Source location, its State, the number of Related Events, and where it Originated. You can also copy the Payload or click on Analyze for more information. Issue summary The issue page is built to first provide the user with bottom line insights to understand the problem and minimize the time needed to resolve it. The following outlines each of the four sections on the issue page: The Analysis Summary: the analysis summary has two machine learning modules, the golden signals and the related components. The Suggested Responder: the suggested responder will tell you who to potentially reach out to on your team to solve a specific problem. The Impacted Entities: an entity is anything that has data you can monitor. Specifically, these are focused on incidents from New Relic sources, extracting the entities and providing a summary. Each entity is unique. The Label Sets: label sets are focused on incidents that come from 3rd party sources, such as PagerDuty, AWS Cloudwatch, REST APIs, etc., as well as for NRQL queries. They come in the form of key:value pairs. All four of these sections can show up together for each issue or separately. It will vary based on the data in the issue. In addition to these four sections, you can also take a look at anomaly overview and entity overview directly from the issue feed. If you hover over an impacted entity application, you’ll notice both call to actions: anomaly overview and entity overview. Anomaly overview will open the application's anomalies page. This is only available for applications that are set up for Proactive Detection. Finally, the issue page contains deployment events. APM’s Deployment page lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. This section will only show up if New Relic has identified applications under the Impacted Entities that have deployments. There are two types of deployment events: deployments and related deployments. Click “Show all deployments”, to see all your deployment events when they arrive. Click a specific deployment to see its APM deployments page. Root cause analysis Root cause analysis automatically finds potential causes for an issue and its impacted entities. It shows you why open issues occurred, which deployments contributed, and relevant error logs and attributes. With this, you can investigate the problem and reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR). Tip Note that root cause analysis is dependent on other New Relic data sources and features. This is why root cause analysis information may not always be present for every issue. When you select an issue, you may see Root cause analysis information. Root cause analysis includes three main UI sections: Deployment events: When you set up deployments, we provide the deployment nearest to the issue creation. Changes, such as deployments, account for a high percentage of the root causes of incidents and having that information at hand can help diagnose and resolve issues. Error logs: You can explore millions of log messages with a single click and use manual querying to help you find anomalous patterns and hard-to-find problems. Attributes to investigate: We scan the distribution of attributes and surface possible causes by finding significant changes in the distribution. For example, for every single transaction event, we can scan to see if an individual user starts to take up an anomalous share of the requests sent to your app. You can also query interesting attributes. Use decisions To further reduce noise or get improved incident correlation, you can change or customize your decisions. Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence groups incidents together. To get started, see Decisions. Use suggested responders If you’re using PagerDuty or New Relic alerts violations as your incident notification tools, Incident Intelligence suggests relevant team members that can help resolve your issues. Incident Intelligence learns from your PagerDuty and alerts violations data to provide suggestions for each new incident. Once you receive a suggestion, you can contact the responder or search for relevant documentation that person may have written. To get started, enable PagerDuty or alerts violations as a source for Incident Intelligence. Afterwards, you can view the suggestions in two places: The issue feed, where you can also provide feedback on the suggestions. Directly within PagerDuty (both UI and API.) If you’re also using PagerDuty as a destination, the suggestions will appear in your issue notifications payload. Important This feature doesn't account for on-call availability at the time of incident. Tip In order to train the model, we use the information PagerDuty provides about individuals. We ingest incident information only, not users’ contact details.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Events vs metrics In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer page has two tabs: Events: In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to any data that can be queried via NRQL. This includes all our major data types, including events and the Metric, Log, and Span data types. Metrics: In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to metric timeslice data. (Note that metric timeslice data is available for querying with NRQL in New Relic One.) For an improved querying and charting experience, we recommend using New Relic One chart builder and dashboards. UI components Use the Events data explorer to view and explore the data available to you. The UI includes: A dropdown that lets you select a data type, like PageView or Transaction. A time-based chart for that data. A sample of that data type, showing its attached attributes, and the ability to see other samples. Ability to search by group by and search for specific attributes. Data samples The most recent sample for the chosen data type is listed at the bottom of the page. Default attributes are underlined. To see more samples, select See more samples.

New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Easily access your insert and query API keys by going to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data> API Keys Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs.

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Golden metrics and golden tags are bits of information about an entity that we consider to be the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic. You can see and contribute to the standard definitions of the golden metrics and tags in this public repository. This document explains how to query an entity's custom metrics using NerdGraph. Tip For more on how to query entities using the NerdGraph API, see our tutorial. Fetch golden metrics When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries are already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value. Here's an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with the GUID ExampleGUID. SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' TIMESERIES Copy You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example: { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenMetrics {   metrics { query title   } } } } } Copy Fetch golden tags Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by GUID or by entityType. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most important about the entity. { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenTags { tags { key } } } } } Copy Customize golden metrics and golden tags If you want to change the golden metrics and golden tags based on the specificities of your environment, you can override them in two different contexts, in your account, or in a workload. Override golden metrics or golden tags for a specific entity type in your whole account In this case, the new golden metrics or the new golden tags will be applied in all New Relic One, converting your new metrics and tags as the default for the specified entity type. To do that, you can use a NerdGraph mutation to override the golden metrics for a specific entity. mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account that you want to override. metrics: The new NRDB query will be shown as golden metrics. eventId: The field used to filter the entity in the metric. How the entity GUID is defined in your event. select: The SELECT clause of the NRDB query. This field is required. from: The FROM clause of the NRDB query. where: Complementary where clause to identify the entity type field. facet: The field to FACET. title: The title of the golden metric. This field is optional. name: The name of the golden metric. This field is required. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy The metrics input object defines the parts of an NRDB query, split into sections. One of these sections is the eventId, which is used to identify the field that defines the GUID inside the NRDB Event you want to use as a golden metric. For example: SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('EntityGuid') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' FACET entityName TIMESERIES Copy It's defined as follows: { eventId: \"entityGuid\", from: \"DatastoreSample\", where: \"provider='DynamoDbTable'\", facet: \"entityName\", select: \"average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)\", name: GetItem latency (ms), title: GetItem latency (ms) } Copy As you can see in the resultant object, the where clause only contains the provider field. The system adds the where clause with the eventId field by default. You can do the same for the golden tags using this NerdGraph mutation: mutation { entityGoldenTagsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, tags: [{key: \"applicationName\"} , {key: \"environment\"} ]) { errors { message type } tags { context { account } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Override golden metrics from a particular entity type in a workload New Relic's workloads provide an aggregated view of health and performance data about a group of entities. The time series charts shown for each entity type in a workload are defined by the golden metrics in the workload account. If you want to further customize which time series to show for a specific entity type in a particular workload, override the golden metrics in the account with the following mutation: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy See above for details on each field. In this case, context is the workload's GUID. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Fetch the custom golden metrics and golden tags The queries defined in the previous sections always return the default golden metrics and golden tags. If you want to fetch your custom golden metrics or golden tags, you need to send the context defined in the query, for example: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenMetrics( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { metrics { title query name } } } } } Copy For golden tags: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenTags(context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { tags { key } } } } } Copy You can send both contexts simultaneously for querying, if your metrics or tags have the context inside the workload. The API returns the most specific golden metric or golden tags based on the context that you defined in the requests. The priority is workload and account. Reset custom metrics and golden tags If your custom golden metrics are not relevant to you any more, you can restore the defaults defined by New Relic. In the context parameter, set the desired account or workload guid (in the guid parameter). To restore your golden metrics in an account, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account you want to reset. To restore your golden metrics in a workload, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: GUID_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy You can do the same for your custom golden tags: mutation { entityGoldenTagsReset( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}) { errors { message type } tags { key context { account guid } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Expected errors All these mutations can answer with the result of the operation or a list of errors. These are all the expected errors that you can receive: INVALID_CONTEXT: The context is not valid. There can only be one context, an account or a workload's GUID. If you use both, or use any other concept, or a GUID that doesn't belong to a workload, you will get this error. INVALID_DOMAIN_TYPE: The domain type is not valid. LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The maximum amount of metrics is 9. If you exceed this limit you will get this error. NOT_AUTHORIZED: The user doesn't have the permissions to carry out this action.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your Amazon VPC data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported. Features The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that utilizes the scalable infrastructure of Amazon Web Services (AWS). With New Relic's VPC integration, you can gain visibility into configuration event changes that are overlaid across your Amazon services. The Amazon VPC integration generates a feed of configuration/inventory changes that occur in your VPC. VPC data is available in pre-built dashboards, and you can create custom queries and charts in New Relic One. You can also create alert conditions to notify you about changes in the VPC. Additionally, Enhanced Amazon VPC Flow Logs enables you to capture information about IP traffic to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Activate To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon VPC integration: Default New Relic polling interval: 15 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the VPC integration links. You can query and explore your data using the PrivateNetworkSample event type, with provider values of: VpcNatGateway VpcVpnTunnel By default, collection of VpcNatGateway, VpcVpnTunnel, and VpcVpnConnection data is disabled. This is because if you have many NAT gateways or many VPNs (connections and tunnels), it might lead to an increase on your CloudWatch bill. For this reason, the integration provides configuration settings to set whether you want to fetch that data. For more on how to use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data VPC NAT Gateway data This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcNatGateway: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC NAT Gateway Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description activeConnectionCount The total number of concurrent active TCP connections through the NAT gateway. bytesInFromDestination The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from the destination. bytesInFromSource The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. bytesOutToDestination The number of bytes sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. bytesOutToSource The number of bytes sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. connectionAttemptCount The number of connection attempts made through the NAT gateway. connectionEstablishedCount The number of connections established through the NAT gateway. errorPortAllocation The number of times the NAT gateway could not allocate a source port. idleTimeoutCount The number of connections that transitioned from the active state to the idle state. An active connection transitions to idle if it was not closed gracefully and there was no activity for the last 350 seconds. packetsDropCount The number of packets dropped by the NAT gateway. packetsInFromDestination The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from the destination. packetsInFromSource The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. packetsOutToDestination The number of packets sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. packetsOutToSource The number of packets sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. VPC VPN Tunnel This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcVpnTunnel: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC VPN Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description tunnelState The state of the tunnel. 0 indicates DOWN and 1 indicates UP. tunnelDataIn The bytes received through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes received after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes received during the period. tunnelDataOut The bytes sent through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes sent after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes sent during the period. Inventory data This integration reports the following VPC configuration options and metadata as inventory data. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to Browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to Browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to Browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in Browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the Browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to Browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to Browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the Browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to Browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID Copy npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key Copy npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Copy Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) Copy npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) Copy npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to Browser: curl -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in Browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Easily access your insert and query API keys by going to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data> API Keys Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint.

This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Easily access your insert and query API keys by going to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data> API Keys Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "Problem Errors in your application aren't reported or captured by the PHP agent as expected. Solution If you are using a third party error handler (for example: XDebug or Laravel's error handler): Disable the third party error handler. Confirm the errors are reporting by viewing the APM errors page. If you are not using a third party error handler, but you still do not see expected errors (for example: 404 errors): Ensure PHP is handling the error, because New Relic cannot report errors that are not recognized by PHP (such as 404 errors for static assets on the web server). Manually instrument the error you are expecting to see by using the newrelic_notice_error() API call. Confirm the errors are reporting by viewing the APM errors page. Cause PHP handles errors with its own default handler. Many third party handlers, such as XDebug or Laravel's error handler, often override PHP's default handler and capture the error instead of PHP. The PHP agent has its own error handler that relies on PHP capturing the error. Since only one handler can handle an error, the agent does not see errors that were already handled by the third party handler before it could get captured by PHP. Additionally, some errors (for example: 404 errors) often occur at the web server level, which means that PHP is never involved and the error is never captured by the agent. If PHP is used to handle 404 errors, use the newrelic_notice_error() API call to manually instrument those errors.

      "body": "With the New Relic dashboards API you can use NerdGraph to build your dashboards. This document explains the different types of widgets you can add to your dashboards, and how to create and get them using the API. Tip To learn how to create a dashboard using this API, see the dashboardCreate mutation. Widget schema and types The widget GraphQL schema for query and mutation outputs looks like this: type Widget { id visualization layout title linkedEntities configuration rawConfiguration } Copy Where: id: The id of the widget. visualization: The widget’s visualization type, as a string. For example: viz.line, viz.area. See the examples below. layout: The widget's position and size in the dashboard. The maximum amount of columns is 12. title: The title of the widget. linkedEntities: Dashboard Entities related to the widget. Currently it only supports dashboard entities. It is used by the facet linking feature. configuration: The typed configuration of the widget. It’s a conveniently typed GraphQL representation of the most common widgets: area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. rawConfiguration: The untyped configuration of the widget. It’s a free-form way (JSON scalar) of storing widget properties not covered by the typed configuration such as heatmap, histogram, bullet, funnel, etc. In this case configuration is null and rawConfiguration holds all the data required by the widget. Types of widgets The dashboards API supports typed and untyped widgets: Typed widgets Typed widgets are area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. They can be built directly using NerdGraph, which provides assistance with the required fields. As an input: You only need to provide the configuration. visualization can be null as long as it can be inferred from the provided configuration. As an output, the API will provide the configuration you provided plus the raw representation in JSON at rawConfiguration. Therefore, rawConfiguration is always a superset of all widget configurations. Untyped widgets Untyped widgets are all other widgets, such as bullet, histogram, inventory, etc. For untyped widgets, we know and validate the shape of the JSON provided. For example, a heatmap has a specific configuration we know in advance, so we can validate it. As an input: configuration is not considered in this case. rawConfiguration must be provided. See the examples below. visualization cannot be null and it should be a fixed string like viz.heatmap or viz.bullet. As an output, the API answers exactly with what was provided in the input. Typed widget definitions Area Area supports multiple nrql queries. Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget. Input { widgets: { configuration: { area: { nrqlQueries: { accountId: 12345678, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } } } rawConfiguration: null } } Copy Output { \"visualization\": \"viz.area\" \"configuration\": { \"area\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] }, \"bar\": null, \"billboard\": null, \"line\": null, \"markdown\": null, \"pie\": null, \"table\": null } \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] } } Copy Bar Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get started To get started with on-host integrations: Browse the lists of on-host integrations. If you do not already have New Relic infrastructure monitoring enabled, install the infrastructure agent. Follow the procedures to install and configure the selected on-host integration, including prerequisites for compatibility and other requirements. If we don't currently offer an integration for a service you use, consider creating your own integration with Flex. Features After you install and activate an integration, you will be able to: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in Infrastructure UI. Create custom queries and charts of your integration data. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance in New Relic's alerts. Monitor remote and multi-tenant configurations Some configurations may use third party elements, such as databases, which reside in non-accessible, remote hosts. Our integrations can fetch data from local and remote hosts or servers, ensuring a continuous monitoring of your service. They also support multi-tenant clustered configurations—by abstracting the service from the host, multiple entities can be monitored as remote instances.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the Docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID. Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "Our five questions form the core of how our Tech Docs team thinks about writing excellent technical documentation. Informally, we call these our 5Qs. Anyone can contribute to our Docs site. We want you to feel confident and proud that your contributions provide valuable content and quality. We also want our readers to trust and easily use the information in our docs. To help you plan, write, and edit excellent docs, ask yourself these five questions. There's really only 1Q Read on for our five questions, but before you do: Know that these questions all exist to help answer one question. Whenever you write a doc, ask yourself: What problem are we trying to solve? It's critical you know what you're trying to do and why that goal matters to your readers. Asking the five questions (and the sub-questions!) will help you ensure you're building the right thing. 5Qs and sub-questions Each of the five questions includes sub-questions to help guide your thinking. 1. Did you use or observe the thing you are writing about? Think about who your audience is and the level of complexity they need. End users' point of view Ask yourself: Audience Do you know who is reading your document (dev/ops teams, support personnel, non-technical staff, etc.)? Can you articulate what this thing is (feature, procedure) and why it matters to our customers? For conceptual info, did you interview multiple stakeholders? Testing Put yourself in the user's shoes. For example: Did you use the thing on your own? Did you watch a subject matter expert use the thing? If you can't do it on your own or observe, did you send the draft to at least three SMEs? Before publishing Did you compare the final version of your text against the thing you're writing about? 2. Is this the best place to put this information? Think about where this information belongs. Where does this information belong? Ask yourself: What problem are you trying to solve? Is text always the best answer? Does this doc need to exist at all? For example: Are we duplicating content from somewhere else in the Docs site? Are we duplicating content already in the UI? Could customers have a better experience if we modified the UI design or copy instead of creating a doc? Would another web property be a better home for this information? For example: The Explorer's Hub? NRU course? NRU video embedded into the doc? The public New Relic blog? The public New Relic website? 3. Can readers tell in ten seconds if they are in the right place? Think about what the content is and what you can do to make the information easy to skim to find information. Can users skim to find information? Ask yourself: Title and headings Does the title accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the headings accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the title and headings use words the way your readers do? Do the title and headings avoid New Relic jargon? Structure Does the overall structure of the doc help readers find what they're looking for? Is the doc trying to address too many topics? When you glance at the doc, do you see short paragraphs, short sentences, and other visual aids? Or do you see a dense wall of text? Introduction Does the intro give a concise synopsis of what's in the doc? Does the intro give readers an alternate path if they're in the wrong place? 4. Is the information in the best possible format? Think about how to present the information visually. Presentation of information Ask yourself: Visual formats Did you use visual formats appropriately? Would a screenshot make any of the information easier to understand? Does your image caption clearly explain what matters so that the user does not necessarily even need to read the surrounding text? Would a diagram make any of the information easier to understand? Is there a video we could embed to make things clearer? Can step-by-step UI procedures be replaced with a \"show me\" video? Procedures Are your procedures well-structured? Do step-by-step UI procedures even need to be documented? Did you limit the procedural text to action steps and omit detailed explanatory text or edge cases? If detailed explanations need to enhance a procedure, have you organized the info in a way that expert users can skip the details? Text flow Read your draft more than once. Is the documentation direct and to the point? Did you use bullets, tables, or clamshells to improve flow? 5. Is the language approachable, expert, and visionary? Think about why the information matters and why readers will trust and use it. For more information, see the Marketing brand guidelines PDF (34.7M). (This is an internal New Relic link.) Effective language Ask yourself: Readers' point of view Did you tell users why as well as how? Can you articulate not only what this thing is (feature, procedure) and also why it matters to our customers? Did you include useful examples or use cases? Did you include information about relationships this feature has to other New Relic platform tools? Style guide resources Did you follow our style guide? Did you use our edit checklist? Did you use pronouns, contractions, and a conversational tone throughout? Did you review the usage dictionary and other resources in the style guide to make sure that terms are used correctly? Readability Is the text easy to read? Is the language clear? Do you have to reread any sentences or paragraphs to understand them? If so, can you simplify the wording and sentence structure? Does the doc score 40 or better on the Flesch-Kinkaid reading ease scale? If not, try taking another pass at the prose. But don't chase the Flesch-Kincaid score in itself: we're not out to frustrate ourselves, but to write docs that are a pleasure to read. Where to go from here Did you offer readers a clear \"next step\" in each section? If it is necessary to tell a user not to do something, did you also tell them what to do instead? Is the topic complete? Is the doc actionable?",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. As software systems grow more complex, the teams building the next generation of websites, apps, and services need tools that can provide end-to-end visibility across the entire stack. New Relic provides these tools—offering the features (such as sub-second query responses on real-time data, dashboards with powerful charting, and flexible alerts) that are essential to building great products. Bundled into all New Relic solutions, Insights enables users to unlock the full power of the un-aggregated, highly dimensional event data collected by New Relic agents. By applying the tips and best practices detailed here, you can use New Relic Insights to build better performance into your systems with every release. 1. Explore your data Important We have an improved way to query and create custom charts: New Relic One. For tips on switching from Insights to New Relic One, see this transition guide. The Insights data explorer offers rich, full-text search across thousands of events and metrics collected by New Relic agents on your applications and hosts. Use it to explore and chart not just the default available data types but also any custom events and metrics you’ve added. For example, if you were to use custom metrics to track messages sent and received on a Kafka queue, you could easily find and add those metrics to a dashboard alongside error rate or throughput trends. From within the metric explorer, you can change the scope of metrics using wildcards, facet your metrics by application host, and expose an API call for the metric via a single click. How to do it (Event explorer) Here's how to use the Insights event data explorer: Go to insights.newrelic.com and select Data explorer > Events. Select a data type to explore. Review the attribute names and values shown for the data matching your view. Select attributes to group by and plot. On the NRQL-generated query, click Run. Configure the chart options as needed. To add individual charts to a dashboard: Give the chart a meaningful title to identify it in a dashboard. Select Add to a dashboard. How to do it (Metric explorer) Here's how to use the Insights metric data explorer: Go to insights.newrelic.com and select Data explorer > Metrics. Select the entity or application your metrics report under. (To select a metric for your chart, browse the top metrics or search for a metric name.) View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To visit the API Explorer (which is preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. 2. Try out NRQL queries Once you’ve explored some of the taxonomy of your data via data explorer, it’s time to start asking some direct questions of your data. You can do this via NRQL: a query language for making calls against our database. If you know SQL, you will already be familiar with a lot of NRQL syntax. And if you don’t know SQL, no worries: We’ll use example queries to get you up and running quickly. At its core, NRQL enables you to query data collected from your application and transform it into dynamic charts. You can then use that data to better understand how your application is used. For example, during incident response, you can test multiple hypotheses by asking and answering multiple questions in rapid succession—down to the individual user or end point (thanks to the un-aggregated, highly dimensional nature of New Relic data). How to do it Use the command-line query tool that appears at the top of your dashboards and on the Query history page to build commands with SQL-style syntax. As you type, the auto-completion feature suggests attributes and flags syntax errors with a red underline. (For more information about NRQL syntax, see Introduction to NRQL and NRQL reference. Here are some example NRQL queries to show you the art of the possible: Out-of-the-box performance: What is the distribution of response times for my app? SELECT histogram(duration, width: 2, buckets: 20) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = YOUR_APP_NAME SINCE 1 day ago Copy What percent of time is spent in the application processing the request (outside of database processing)? SELECT (1-(average(duration)-average(databaseDuration))/average(duration))*100 AS '% of time in DB' FROM Transaction FACET name WHERE appName = YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Lightweight custom instrumentation to drill down to an individual user: SELECT count(*) FROM MobileCrash WHERE `authentication_email` = ‘exampleuser@newrelic.com' Authentication_email is a custom attribute that’s been added to the default MobileCrash event type with a single line of code. (Find out more here.) See more examples: Try out the tutorials on your Insights homepage. If you’re using the New Relic Mobile agent, try out these examples. 3. Pin charts from other New Relic products Now that you’ve explored your data and asked some questions, it’s time to learn how Insights can be integrated with charts from other New Relic products. Using the add-to-Insights feature, you can pin any New Relic chart to an Insights dashboard. How to do it Mouse over the chart. Click the Add to an Insights Dashboard button. From the Copy chart dialog box: Select Copy to an existing dashboard (default) or Copy to a new dashboard. Edit the chart name as needed (maximum length: 255 characters). Click Copy. (Note: You can switch accounts from this dialog box to copy to different dashboards across accounts. You can also click the dashboard name in the green success bar to go the dashboard to which you added the chart.) 4. Create dashboard notes To make your dashboard more usable across your entire organization, use the dashboard notes feature to add context to any dashboard. Have a chart you’d like to describe for others? Have important links that go hand-in-hand with the dashboard (for example a runbook)? Dashboard notes allow you to add arbitrary text and images to your dashboard. Add notes to dashboards to record or share custom information about the dashboard. Because these notes use markdown syntax, it is easy to add elements such as headings, images, links, and so on. How to do it At the top of the dashboard, select Add Dashboard note. 5. Designate dashboards as favorites Get fast access to key dashboards by designating them as favorites. How to do it: To make a dashboard a favorite, click the star icon. (Favorite dashboards appear at the top of the dashboards list.) To remove a dashboard from your favorites, click the star icon again. 5. Apply a filter to a dashboard You can easily drill down into specifics about your data in Insights. All you have to do to change the data presented is input text into a search box. For example, anyone can visit a dashboard and input a user's email address to access data un-aggregated for that user. How to do it: On the dashboard, select Edit. Then select Filter disabled or click the gear icon. Select Enable filter. From the Event types drop-down menu, select one or more data types. From the Select attribute drop-down menu, select one or more attributes to restrict filtering to specific attributes. Select Filter enabled or click the blue gear icon again to close the Filter menu. To save your changes to the dashboard, select Done editing. 6. Build a data app Do you want to present a bunch of dashboards as a whole? Are you thinking about sharing information beyond your DevOps teams? Data apps can help you do so. Designed to let users create self-service analytics reports that even non-technical users can employ to answer questions about performance, customers, feature usage, and more, data apps let business users click through preset drill-downs and modify their filters in real time via basic searches. As collections of linked dashboards that create curated, application-like experiences, data apps work on any attributes available in Insights. How to do it: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > Create a data app. Specify an Icon, Title, URL, Description, and Permissions for your app. Select Create to save your new data app. After creating your data app, Insights automatically redirects you to a new dashboard. You can add widgets to this dashboard using standard NRQL queries. You can also create additional dashboards by selecting + Add from the data app navigation bar, or by copying an existing dashboard into your data app: From your data app dashboard, select Edit, then select Configure data app. From the Copy dropdown menu, choose a dashboard. (Dashboard copies are independent of the original dashboard—meaning changes to the original dashboard do not affect the copy, and editing or deleting the copied dashboard does not affect the original.) Learn more about data apps. 7. Link facets across dashboards within a data app Facet linking is a powerful way to build dashboards to tell a deep story around specific filters. For example, you can use the FACET clause in NRQL to break out your data by any string attribute. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (the default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. By using FACET linking, a user can jump to details of an individual company on a prebuilt dashboard showing specifics for that company. How to do it: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > (select a data app). Select the dashboard containing the widget you want to link from; then select Edit. From the widget you want to link, select the link icon. Select the target dashboard from the list. 8. Add a custom attribute and/or event via a New Relic agent All New Relic agents report some event data by default, out of the box. For example, each time a Mobile event occurs, more than 35 attributes are added, providing a wealth of ways to slice and dice your data. This allows you to troubleshoot faster, understand better, and focus on creating value rather than putting out fires. Eventually, however, you will probably want to add custom attributes to your event data. For example: you might want to add a unique user ID attribute that will let you see performance data on an individual user. With just a few lines of code, you can add custom attributes to your event data to enhance your ability to dashboard and filter your data along with other methods depending on the language. Since the approach you use will be specific to the agent you’re employing, we’ve provided a couple of examples below. Please view the New Relic docs for specifics on the agent you’re using. How to do it (for Java via agent API; you can also use an XML approach) To collect custom attributes via API, call the relevant methods. For each method you want to record an attribute, call addCustomParameter. Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include the following code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId). How to do it (for Agent API via Java APM agent) Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); In the above example, the first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Simply add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10,000 events, use the following: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. 9. Add a custom event Insights end point You can also enhance the information you report about your applications and systems by creating a custom event—via either a New Relic agent API or the Event API. If you chose the latter, you can send information from your system without adding a New Relic agent to it. You get all the benefits of our agent’s deep instrumentation in other parts of your stack in places where we don’t have an agent or you don’t want to add one. Keep in mind that Insights only supports event insertion via POST. Follow the instructions below to start reporting a new event type. How to do it: Go to the Manage data section of Insights. Click the API Keys tab. Register an Event API Insert key. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit the JSON to the Insights HTTPS end point using cURL in a POST request. (More info) Be sure to check out New Relic API Explorer By taking advantage of New Relic API Explorer (available at https://api.newrelic.com), Admin users and those with the API Key can: Browse available API end points Interact with the API within a user interface (the API Explorer) View a live source of documentation Obtain cURL commands for API actions Share configured API calls with colleagues by copy and pasting API Explorer URLs.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent 3.9.0 or higher supports both the Java Message Service (JMS) 1.1 API and the RabbitMQ Java client library. This gives you insights into the performance of your message processing, for both incoming and outgoing messages. The APM UI will show transactions initiated via JMS 1.1 or RabbitMQ message receipt as Message background tasks. Message creation via JMS or RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9. New Relic's Java agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library and JMS. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages handled by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"dequeued\" messages APM's conveniently group and report operations that interact with temporary queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify areas where processes take too much time and may be handled better as background messages. Installation requirements To monitor your RabbitMQ client activity, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's Java agent version 3.9.0 or higher. To monitor JMS, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's Java agent version 3.3.1 or higher. Tip For additional monitoring of your RabbitMQ systems, use the free RabbitMQ plugin for New Relic. This plugin is published and supported by Pivotal, the corporate parents of RabbitMQ. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ basicPublish basicGet, nextDelivery, and handleDelivery JMS send receive, receiveNoWait, and onMessage View message queue operations Queue operations appear in APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example. APM > Applications > (selected app) > Monitor >Transactions > (selected transaction): The transaction’s Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message). Transaction traces also may provide additional details. Tip You can select transaction traces from the app's Summary or Transactions pages in APM. The Transaction trace summary page also may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: APM > Applications > (selected app) > Monitor > Summary > (selected transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results. The Transaction trace page also may include a dedicated Messages tab. Here is an example.

The Guzzle library allows both sequential and parallel requests. This page describes how each type of request will appear in the Summary page in the New Relic UI. To discover which call was the slowest, view the External Services page which displays timing for individual external calls. Sequential requests This PHP code makes multiple sequential requests with Guzzle: $client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client; $response = $client->get('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo'); $client->delete('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo/'.$response->getBody()); Copy This code would appear in the New Relic UI as: one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Overview > Web transactions time: Sequential requests with Guzzle in the New Relic UI.

Because the requests were made sequentially, the response time is equal to the total time spent in PHP, MySQL, and web external activities. Parallel requests This PHP code makes multiple requests in parallel by unwrapping an array of promises: $client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client; $promises = [ $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo'), $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/bar'), $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/quux'), ]; \\GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\unwrap($promises); Copy This code would appear in the New Relic UI as: one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Summary > Web transactions time: Parallel requests with Guzzle in the New Relic UI The green web external time represents time spent in the Guzzle library. Because the requests were performed asynchronously, the total time spent in PHP, MySQL, and web external is greater than the response time. Timing with Guzzle 6 Unlike previous versions, Guzzle 6 does not generate an event when a request is sent. Instead, the agent begins timing a request when the request object is created. If a request object is created and additional work is done before sending, New Relic may report that the request took longer than it actually did. Disable Guzzle support To disable Guzzle support: Add newrelic.guzzle.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini file. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.).

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. The newer model offers a much simpler, more efficient way to manage users and what they have access to (learn more about the benefits of the new model). At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and our existing customers' users remained on our original user model. Now some of our original-model customers can use a migration wizard in the UI to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Requirements The easiest way to see if you have access to the user migration wizard is to check if it’s visible in the UI. Factors affecting access to the migration wizard: You must have the Owner role. The migration wizard is not available for some organizations that have a more complex account structure. If the migration wizard is not available and you wish to migrate your users, contact your New Relic account representative. Before beginning The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first understand our new user management concepts. A brief summary: Users reside within a container known as an “authentication domain,” which governs how those users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI vs. automatically with a SCIM-based identity provider), and how they log in (manually with email/password vs. using SAML SSO), and other settings. Typically organizations have just one or two domains: one with the default manual settings and one for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often in multiple groups. When you want to add new groups, or give groups access to more accounts, you must create an access grant. This assigns a group access to: 1) a specific role and 2) a specific account. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role (a role being a custom set of capabilities). The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first plan out how your user groups and access grants will be structured. Use the user migration wizard If you meet the requirements, you can use the wizard. To start using the migration wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation and then click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: if you have problems, see Tips. Once your users are migrated to the new model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs. full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs. Tips on using the migration wizard The migration wizard is meant to have all the context you need to complete the migration process but here are some tips for potential areas of confusion: Guided setup vs. automatic setup: Simple organizations with few users and few accounts, and who have little need for users to have separate roles or separate account access, may decide to choose the automatic setup. If you require some user access customization, or if your users use SAML SSO to sign in or are managed via an identity service provider (like Okta), use the guided setup. Once an account’s Owner does the initial step in the wizard of migrating admins, those admins are then able to access and complete the remainder of the migration wizard. The migration wizard gives you an option to download a full list of your existing original user model users (aka v1 users) before choosing to migrate users. We recommend downloading that file because it can serve as a useful reference and, in case it’s needed, as a backup file. To check on the status of your user migration, you can go to the User management UI to see which users are on the new model. After migration, some users may end up with access to logins for both an original model account and a new model account, both associated with a single email address. This is because our original user model allowed a user, with a single login, to access data from multiple organizations (a common scenario for contractors, for example). But the new user model gives more user control to organizations, and this means that these users now need a different login for each organization. If a user previously had access that spanned multiple organizations, they retain an original user record until migration is completed for all associated organizations. When a user has an email address associated with multiple logins, they'll be asked to verify their email. If your email address is associated with multiple logins, you can verify your email to see those accounts. In the example above, the “Original New Relic account” refers to that user record being on the older, original account/user model.",

      "body": "This document contains detailed descriptions of resources and procedures that are referenced in the New Relic .NET agent install procedures. Important This document is not meant to be read as a standalone document. For install instructions, see Introduction to .NET agent install. Microsoft's .NET profiler New Relic’s .NET agent relies on the Microsoft profiling API to report data from your .NET application. .NET monitoring solutions other than New Relic can use this profiling API. But only one service can use the profiler at a time. This means that if you have used a .NET monitoring service in the past and haven’t completely disabled/removed it, the profiler may still be in use, which will cause profiler conflicts when you try to enable the .NET agent. .NET agent download library The New Relic .NET agent download library contains install file packages that are referenced in specific install procedures. For more on these files, see the download library’s ReadMe file. Zip files for manual .NET agent install (Windows) To manually install the agent using a ZIP file, choose the correct file for the application you wish to monitor: Go to the .NET agent download site and get the file matching your application's runtime and architecture: .NET Framework (32-bit): newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.zip .NET Framework (64-bit): newrelic-agent-win-x64-VERSION.zip .NET Core (32-bit): newrelic-netcore20-agent-win-x86-VERSION.zip .NET Core (64-bit): newrelic-netcore20-agent-win-x64-VERSION.zip Unzip the agent folder in the desired location. Set environment variables for the process you wish to monitor. Caution We do not recommend setting these environment variables globally. Setting these environment variables globally can cause all .NET processes running on the system to get instrumented and report to New Relic. If you are installing the agent manually, we expect that you have the means to set these environment variables only for the processes you wish to monitor. .NET Framework environment variables for manual install For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory COR_PROFILER_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll Copy .NET Core environment variables for manual install For .NET Core, the following variables are required: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll Copy Restart your application. If using IIS, restart IIS. If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Need for custom instrumentation After installing a .NET agent, most .NET application frameworks will automatically report data to your New Relic account. (See app framework compatibility: .NET Framework | .NET Core.) If your .NET application uses an application framework that is not automatically instrumented, or if the app has no framework (like a console app), after the install you will need to manually set up instrumentation of your app. Here are the steps to do that: Follow the relevant install instructions for your application and framework. Custom instrument your application to define what activity is reported to New Relic. Install-related environment variables A .NET agent install requires setting environment variables. For some install procedures (like for IIS-hosted .NET applications), these environment variables are set automatically. For other install procedures, you will have to manually set them. To see the required environment variables for both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications, see Environment variables. For installations requiring you to manually set environment variables, you can also set other configuration options via environment variables. Here's a look at two that are commonly set: License key. The environment variable for setting the New Relic license key is: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY = YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy You can also set this in the newrelic.config file or the app's config file. App name. Setting a meaningful application name is recommended, but you can also set this after install. The environment variable is: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME = YOUR_APP_NAME Copy You can also set this via the newrelic.config, the app's config file, or the API. Scriptable installers (Windows only) The scriptable installers are ZIP archives containing a PowerShell script for installing the .NET agent. There is a separate zip archive for .NET Framework versus .NET Core. Important We recommend using the MSI installer over the scriptable installer. If you want to automate your install, consider running the MSI installer from the command line. Scriptable installer for .NET Framework To use the scriptable installer to install the .NET agent for a .NET Framework app: Ensure you have administrator rights for your Windows admin group. For more details on this, see the permissions documentation. Download the scriptable installer package for .NET Framework from the download site. By downloading or using one of these packages, you agree to and accept the license terms. Unzip the package. Open a command shell and navigate into the unzipped package's folder. For a simple install with no options, use this command: .\\install.cmd -LicenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the format below. See table below for a description of the install options. install.cmd -LicenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY [-NoIISReset] [-InstrumentAll] [-InstallPath PATH_TO_INSTALL] Copy If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Install options Description LicenseKey Required. Your New Relic license key. NoIISReset Optional. Use this option to prevent the installer from initiating an IIS reset. Important If you use this option, you need to do an IIS reset manually before New Relic starts instrumenting any IIS-hosted applications. InstrumentAll Optional. By default, the .NET agent will instrument all IIS-hosted applications. Use this option to enable instrumentation of other types of .NET applications. InstallPath Optional. Use this option to choose a different installation location. The default install location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic. Uninstalling the agent with the scriptable uninstaller: Tip You can add the Force option to the uninstall script to force an uninstall without prompting to restart IIS. Execute the following command to uninstall the .NET Framework agent: .\\uninstall.cmd Copy Scriptable installer for .NET Core Important Before installing the agent: Understand the agent requirements, including the permissions requirements. Note that admin rights in an elevated shell are required (specifically for selecting a custom log directory and performing an IISReset). Caution For security reasons, it is necessary to execute the installAgent.ps1 script as shown below, by prepending ./ to the script filename, rather than by prepending powershell to the script. If you execute the script by prepending powershell, and any of your supplied arguments (e.g. the install path or custom log path) have spaces in them, these arguments will be corrupted, which would lead to the agent being installed to a location other than the intended location, which could be unsecure. To use the scriptable installer to install the .NET agent for a .NET Core application: Ensure you have administrator rights for your Windows admin group. For more details on this, see the permissions documentation Download the .NET Core agent's scriptable installer package from the .NET agent download site . By downloading or using one of these packages, you agree to and accept the license terms. Unzip the package in the desired location. Open a command shell and navigate into the unzipped package's folder. You can install the agent either locally or globally: Local install For a simple install, with no options, use this command: ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType global -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\"] Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the same command with desired options. For option descriptions, see table below. ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType local -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\" -X86 -ResetIIS -Force] Copy Global install Important The global install will instrument all .NET Core processes on your system. Only choose the global install if you want all .NET Core processes monitored. For a simple install with no options, use this command: ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType global -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\"] Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the same command with desired options. For option descriptions, see table below. ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType local -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\" -X86 -ResetIIS -Force] Copy If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Install options Description Destination Required. The location where the agent is installed. This can be an absolute or relative path. Wrapping quotes are required. InstallType Required. Determines whether this is a local (app-specific) or global (system-wide) install. LicenseKey Required. Your New Relic license key. AppName Optional. Sets the default application name associated with your agent installation. LogDir Optional. Sets a custom logging location for the agent. By default, the agent puts the logs directory in the install directory. X86 Optional. Installs the 32-bit version of the agent rather than the 64-bit version. New Relic does not recommend installing the 32-bit version of the agent globally. ResetIIS Optional. Performs an iisreset after the installation. Important Only use this if your .NET Core app is hosted via an IIS reverse proxy. Force Optional. Forces the installation process to overwrite a previous install or to install into an existing folder. Caution This overwrites any configuration customizations. New Relic recommends backing up your configuration file and any custom instrumentation files prior to forcing an over-install. Help Optional. Displays usage information for this script.",

This document introduces you to the REST API Explorer, which allows admin users and those with the API Key to: Browse the available REST API endpoints. Interact with the REST API within a user interface (the API Explorer). View a live source of documentation. Obtain curl commands for API actions. Share configured API calls with colleagues by copy and pasting API Explorer's URLs. This helps you to quickly search for solutions and test your API calls before adding them to your own software components. Features New Relic's API Explorer includes an interactive user interface for your selected account. The API Explorer UI lists the types of API calls (Applications, Users, etc.) and their available functions, such as GET metric data, PUT (update) applications, DELETE applications, etc. As you type values for Parameters, they automatically appear in the Request so that you can test and verify your syntax before sending the request. The UI indicates required fields, field descriptions, their type (integer, float, Boolean, etc.), and their location (path, query, etc.). For information on API keys, see REST API keys. https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore: The New Relic API Explorer makes it easy to test and send requests for any API endpoint. After you select your account and your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, users, etc.), the UI provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. Differences from API version 1 This API Explorer applies only to the New Relic REST API version 2, which focuses on data in and data out of New Relic. Version 2 replaces New Relic's deprecated REST API version 1. Be aware there are some differences between version 2 and 1: Names for data may be different. Some cURL commands for v2 are different than v1. Tip The New Relic agents use different APIs and are not accessible via the API Explorer. For more help",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Project Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list service.usage.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "A new season represents a time for change. As we reflect on the past few months at New Relic, we’ve had quite a few changes of our own. In July, we simplified our pricing model and reimagined New Relic One. Since then, we’ve released 40+ new features, capabilities, and integrations to help you deliver value to your customers. To recap this season, we’ve asked our engineers and product managers to list their favorite features to help you be more productive and collaborative. Here are the top 10: 1. Dark mode When you're resolving incidents in the middle of the night or want to avoid straining your eyes, you can view New Relic One in dark mode. Dark mode is way more than just a cool feature (though it still is that). For many industries, dark mode is essential. Learn more here. 2. New AWS integrations Get end-to-end visibility into your AWS cloud services and the rest of your stack with valuable new integrations: AWS Lambda Extensions make it substantially easier to send telemetry data from AWS Lambda to New Relic One. AWS Control Tower automatically integrates with New Relic One for single or multi-account environments enrolled in AWS Control Tower. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry uses the OpenTelemetry Collector and New Relic exporter to send telemetry data from your AWS services to New Relic One. AWS X-Ray integration automatically combines traces from AWS managed services with traces from New Relic for end-to-end observability visualized entirely within New Relic One. You can capture, filter, and query it all—no manual instrumentation required. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse helps you ingest and forward CloudWatch Logs data into New Relic One to expand the insights into your cloud stack. AWS Bottlerocket helps provide full visibility into workloads and infrastructure, including Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS in New Relic One. New Relic also achieved AWS Outposts Ready Designation, which recognizes that New Relic One offers complete visibility into AWS compute, storage, database, and a full range of other available AWS services in the AWS regions. If you build, deploy, or maintain apps and critical workloads on AWS, you can now get full, instant access to all of New Relic One for free, and only pay for what you use beyond 100 GB per month when you subscribe to New Relic in the AWS Marketplace. 3. OpenTelemetry UI New Relic One now has a UI dedicated to providing full APM functionality for your OpenTelemetry data. Send your OpenTelemetry data to New Relic using one of the OpenTelemetry exporters and quickly discover and analyze your data to optimize the performance of your applications and services using one of seven key pages. Learn more. New Relic OpenTelemetry UI 4. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic users with Pro or Enterprise Full-Stack Observability can now access and benefit from New Relic Edge with a fully managed, cloud-native, tail-based distributed tracing service. This new service observes 100% of all application traces across your distributed systems, and provides visualization and storage for the most actionable data so you can investigate and solve issues faster. Learn more here. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing UI 5. What’s new? When there are product updates, New Relic One notifies you and directs you to What’s new, your in-product destination to learn more about what we’ve released.

Learn more here. Go to What's new to see recent feature additions and updates. 6. Anomalies visible in the activity stream You can now view anomalies with the activity stream, which is visible from the New Relic One homepage, APM summary page, and APM list page. The activity stream displays recent events from alerts and deployments and provides a direct view into what has changed in your system so that you can fix outages quickly. Learn more here. Anomalies visible in activity stream 7. Kafka Connect Unlock open source and alternative instrumentation sources by ingesting data from Apache Kafka topics into New Relic One, without writing a single line of code, with the New Relic connector for Kafka Connect. Learn more here. New Relic connector for Kafka Conect 8. Windows support for logs You can now send all of your logs to New Relic using the infrastructure agent in Windows. This feature includes new filters to select exactly which log types (application, security, or system) and messages you are interested in, all the way down to the EventID. Learn more here. We now support Windows logs via our infrastructure agent. 9. Share with permalink Share insights, dashboards, and curated views from anywhere in New Relic One by clicking the permalink icon to copy a short, permanent URL to your clipboard automatically.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple Insights events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of Insights events for transactions. To avoid duplicate Insights events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. To prevent duplicate events from being collected for an app with multiple names, go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Configure data sources. Roll up Browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any Browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other Browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster.

This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "The HashiCorp Consul on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Consul environment to New Relic, where you can see the health of your Consul datacenter environment. We collect data on both the datacenter and agent/node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with HashiCorp Consul 1.0 or newer. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Consul is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running Consul. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. If using ACL, the credentials for the Consul integration must have the following policies: agent:read, node:read, and service:read. Quick start Instrument your Consul environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Guided install EU Guided install Tip If you're hosted in the EU, use our EU guided install. Install and activate To install the HashiCorp Consul integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-consul. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp consul-config.yml.sample consul-config.yml Copy Edit the consul-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-consul .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-consul/nri-consul-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-consul-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp consul-config.yml.sample consul-config.yml Copy Edit the consul-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, consul-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see Example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts one command: all_data: collects both inventory and metrics for the HashiCorp Consul environment. Important If you run a cluster environment in Kubernetes and use autodiscovery to monitor Consul pods, you may receive duplicated cluster data. Facet by node for creating dashboards and alerts. Arguments The configuration command accepts the following arguments: hostname: The hostname or IP of a Consul node within the cluster. Defaults: localhost. Required. port: Port to connect to node on. Default: 8500. Required. fan_out: Whether to connect to other Consul agents to collect node data from them. Default: true. token: ACL Token if token authentication is enabled. enable_ssl: Whether or not to connect using SSL. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: If set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied CA Bundles. Default: false. ca_bundle_file: Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file, required if enable_ssl is set to true and trust_server_certificate is set to false. ca_bundle_dir: Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory, required if enable_ssl is set to true and trust_server_certificate is set to false. Example configuration Example consul-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration integration_name: com.newrelic.consul instances: - name: consul-prod command: all_data arguments: hostname: consul-dev-0.consul.localnet token: my_token labels: env: production role: consul Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: ConsulDatacenterSample ConsulAgentSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The HashiCorp Consul integration collects the following metric data attributes.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Currently the patterns feature is opt-in; if you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, contact your account representative and ask to have it enabled. There will be up to a 24 hour lead time before the machine learning (ML) system generates a customized model for your account. Patterns will be available for all customers to enable or disable on demand at the end of April 2021. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore patterns and logs with no pattern By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs With No Pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs With No Pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Why don't I see Pattern data? The following are a few reasons why you might have Patterns enabled but not have any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, please contact support. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since Patterns was enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a \"message\" field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the \"message\" field of a log record. If your logs don't contain \"message,\" there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with, log patterns such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Requirements Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements: This tutorial is for managing users on our New Relic One user model. Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise tier. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs: Where to find user management features in the UI Important user management concepts This tutorial will walk you through how to: View available accounts How to grant groups access to roles and accounts How to create custom roles How to add users to groups View available accounts Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant groups access to roles and accounts Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you're on our Pro or Enterprise tier, you have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization. Tip Note that you can also import users from your identity provider. To view existing group access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. To grant a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing group or a new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about these concepts, see User management concepts. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under Scope, select Organization and choose the Authentication domain manager role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see Standard roles. (Note that these users must also have an account-scoped role. Without that, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. Some important tips to understand when managing groups: If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group. Create custom role When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our default standard roles that have default capabilities, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Note that there are some hidden capabilities that are not available for adding to a custom role. For details, see Capabilities. To learn more about how roles and groups relate, see User management concepts. Add users If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. To view or manage users: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access.

For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list.

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic One supports a variety of visualizations to present your data in whatever format works best for your needs. A chart's refresh rate is calculated based on the query's timeframe. Chart types for events You can browse your data using several options in New Relic One, including: Data explorer Basic or advanced (NRQL) queries Advanced PromQL-style mode When you create a chart in the New Relic One query builder, you can select any of the chart types appropriate for that query. Depending on the data specified in your query, some chart types may be unavailable (grayed out). A small table shows the availability status of a chart type for Insights and New Relic One. Area chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. If you're using advanced (NRQL) mode you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use Area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid Area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Attribute sheet Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights An attribute sheet is a list of values for a single set of selected attributes. It is similar to the table chart type but is an option only when you are not using a FACET clause. The attribute sheet shows the single value from the query results. Use attribute street when you want to View a list of attributes for a set of single-value attributes. Avoid attribute street when you want to View data when you have used FACET function in your query. The table chart type is an option when your query uses FACET or when you have multiple values for each attribute. Bar chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use billboard when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use bullet when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid bullet when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. The bullet chart type is not supported in Insights; use the gauge chart type instead. Event [check icon] Basic mode [check icon] Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights * * * * The event chart type lists the data in a text format. Use event when you want to Create a text file that contains the attribute name and its value. The file can be shared and the content easily embedded into a report or spreadsheet, for example. Avoid event when you want to Present the data in a graphic, which can be helpful when monitoring the event on a dashboard. The billboard chart type is a good option for single-value data visualization. Funnel Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use funnels to evaluate a series of related events that are the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Gauge Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the gauge chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The gauge chart type displays a single value compared against a limit. The gauge defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, select in the Limit field and enter another number; the gauge will adjust accordingly. When the value returned by the query exceeds the limit value, the gauge shows the limit value in blue, and the overage in purple. Use gauge when you want to View a large and easy-to-read comparison a value compared against a limit that you set. Avoid gauge when you want to Create a query that uses COMPARE WITH, as gauge will not be listed as an option. Gauge is not supported in New Relic One; use the bullet chart type instead. Heat map Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode> ** * * **Insights** * * ** The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram Basic mode ** Advanced (NRQL) mode * * ** Insights * * * * * * A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. Tip If you are using Insights, copy the JSON using the Copy JSON button. If you are using New Relic One query builder, use the Share menu to select Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSOON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart chart type plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic mode in New Relic One, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When working with an NRQL query, either in Insights or advanced (NRQL) mode in New Relic One, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. List Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode< Insights The list chart type lists unique values for a given attribute. It is an option when the uniques( ) function is used in the select method. The list chart type shows the set of unique values for a given attribute. Use list when you want to Create a list of the value associated with each attribute. This list can be shared and easily added to reports and spreadsheets, for example. Avoid list when you want to When the data you want to view has multiple values for each attribute. The event chart type may be an option for New Relic One users. Pie chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart chart type maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic mode. If you're using Insights or advanced (NRQL) mode, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Table Basic mode< Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry will take you to an existing dashboard that is filtered by that attribute. If you have multiple dashboards filtered by that attribute, Insights selects the first one created. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid table when you want to View your data in a graphical format. Chart types for metric data Metric chart are unique from other event-based charts. You can view aggregated metric data reported to New Relic from your agent. To add and customize metric charts on your Insights dashboard, use the Metric Explorer. The metric explorer is not yet supported in New Relic One. However, once you have added a metric chart to dashboard, you can use the query builder in advanced (NRQL) mode to edit the query. To use advanced (NRQL) mode in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click the query data icon. If the query builder opens in basic mode, click Advanced (NRQL) in the top right corner of the basic mode container. Use the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode to select the query associated with the metric chart on the Insights dashboard. When you open the query builder, you will see the last query mode you used, either basic mode or advanced (NRQL) mode. The My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode will display all of your New Relic queries, for both Insights and New Relic One, for both basic and advanced (NRQL) modes.",

      "body": "With the New Relic dashboards API you can use NerdGraph to build your dashboards. This document explains the different types of widgets you can add to your dashboards, and how to create and get them using the API. Tip To learn how to create a dashboard using this API, see the dashboardCreate mutation. Widget schema and types The widget GraphQL schema for query and mutation outputs looks like this: type Widget { id visualization layout title linkedEntities configuration rawConfiguration } Copy Where: id: The id of the widget. visualization: The widget’s visualization type, as a string. For example: viz.line, viz.area. See the examples below. layout: The widget's position and size in the dashboard. The maximum amount of columns is 12. title: The title of the widget. linkedEntities: Dashboard Entities related to the widget. Currently it only supports dashboard entities. It is used by the facet linking feature. configuration: The typed configuration of the widget. It’s a conveniently typed GraphQL representation of the most common widgets: area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. rawConfiguration: The untyped configuration of the widget. It’s a free-form way (JSON scalar) of storing widget properties not covered by the typed configuration such as heatmap, histogram, bullet, funnel, etc. In this case configuration is null and rawConfiguration holds all the data required by the widget. Types of widgets The dashboards API supports typed and untyped widgets: Typed widgets Typed widgets are area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. They can be built directly using NerdGraph, which provides assistance with the required fields. As an input: You only need to provide the configuration. visualization can be null as long as it can be inferred from the provided configuration. As an output, the API will provide the configuration you provided plus the raw representation in JSON at rawConfiguration. Therefore, rawConfiguration is always a superset of all widget configurations. Untyped widgets Untyped widgets are all other widgets, such as bullet, histogram, inventory, etc. For untyped widgets, we know and validate the shape of the JSON provided. For example, a heatmap has a specific configuration we know in advance, so we can validate it. As an input: configuration is not considered in this case. rawConfiguration must be provided. See the examples below. visualization cannot be null and it should be a fixed string like viz.heatmap or viz.bullet. As an output, the API answers exactly with what was provided in the input. Typed widget definitions Area Area supports multiple nrql queries. Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget. Input { widgets: { configuration: { area: { nrqlQueries: { accountId: 12345678, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } } } rawConfiguration: null } } Copy Output { \"visualization\": \"viz.area\" \"configuration\": { \"area\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] }, \"bar\": null, \"billboard\": null, \"line\": null, \"markdown\": null, \"pie\": null, \"table\": null } \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] } } Copy Bar Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget.

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Docker Compose Create a folder to store the configuration files: mkdir ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Change directory to the one you've just created: cd ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" > newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create the newrelic-infra.dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: touch newrelic-infra.dockerfile Copy vim newrelic-infra.dockerfile #you can use any text editor Copy Put the following content in the file: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create docker-compose.yaml: touch docker-compose.yaml Copy vim docker-compose.yaml #you can use any text editor Copy Put following content in the file: version: '3' services: agent: container_name: newrelic-infra build: context: . dockerfile: newrelic-infra.dockerfile cap_add: - SYS_PTRACE network_mode: host pid: host privileged: true volumes: - \"/:/host:ro\" - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" restart: unless-stopped Copy Build and start docker-compose: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next?

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Notes This release marks the start of a brand new series of PHP agent releases. This represents many months of performance tuning, stability improvements and additional new features. All existing users are highly encouraged to upgrade to the latest agent. There are many changes in this version, the most interesting of which are listed below. All users who are upgrading from a previous release are encouraged to read the upgrade notes document to fully understand some of the impacts of upgrading. Highlights of this release include: Drastic memory usage reduction. The agent overhead is down from approximately 35% to just 4%. Significantly less stack space used (down from 40K per PHP function call to just 84 bytes). This affects users with deeply recursive functions. License keys are now set in the INI file and not the daemon configuration file, and they are settable on a per-directory or per-virtual host basis. This very frequently requested feature will allow multi-tenant sites to use different keys for each tenant. The New Relic daemon can now be started automatically by the agent. For upgrade customers it will still be started the way it always was with the init scripts, but you can now change that by configuring the daemon in your INI file. Please see this page on daemon startup modes for details. Several bugs related to auto-RUM (Real User Monitoring) have been fixed, including a fix for non-standard HTML (where the head element is at the end of the document). The agent startup \"banner\" now contains much more useful information that can be included in the initial dialog with support, and will short-circuit the typical \"what OS and PHP version are you using exactly?\" preamble to getting a ticket resolved. The agent and daemon no longer use a UNIX-domain socket for their communications. Now a standard TCP socket (port 33142 by default) is used, which makes deploying in a chroot environment a lot easier. The RPM and Debian packages have been split into three separate packages: the agent, the daemon and common scripts between the two. This was primarily done so that the agent was in its own package, and on 64-bit systems the agent package now only contains the 64-bit agent. This means that 64-bit users do not have to install the entire 32-bit runtime just to install the PHP agent. The 32-bit agent can always be installed alongside the 64-bit one. The phpinfo() output has been changed to more clearly distinguish between global and per-directory settings. It now also correctly displays the per-directory value if the script was invoked from within a directory that changed default values. The newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100 setting has been renamed to newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. You can now arbitrarily begin and end transactions (for example, at the beginning and end of each job queue unit of work). This is done using the new newrelic_end_transaction and newrelic_start_transaction API calls. The daemon has been considerably simplified and uses fewer locks, thus reducing the potential for entering a \"spin\" state. Many other improvements to speed and stability.",

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: page load timed-out Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Tip To use Incident Intelligence and Applied Intelligence, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these four steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per master account and its sub-accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one master account. Need to change the environment's associated account? Reach out to your account executive or our support team for help. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. PagerDuty You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Tip Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can also set PagerDuty as a destination, as well as any other destination compatible with webhook: Send data to PagerDuty Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Kubernetes installation with Helm. To install the integration using manifests, see Kubernetes integration: install and configure. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Start the installer Compatibility and requirements Our Helm chart is compatible with both Helm 2 and 3. Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Follow the instructions for your version of Helm: Helm 3 using nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to Logs. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Automatically injects metadata in applications deployed to the cluster to correlate APM monitoring with Infrastructure monitoring. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, allows to scrape Prometheus endpoints and report metrics to New Relic. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics for you if needed. We recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it provides the easiest way to select, install, and upgrade individual components at your will. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent isn't installed. helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy You can flip the ksm.enabled flag to true if KSM isn't already present in your cluster. Install the Kubernetes integration: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Configuring nri-bundle with Helm Enabling and disabling subcharts The nri-bundle chart pulls the following dependencies, if the corresponding flags are enabled: Subchart Flag newrelic-infrastructure infrastructure.enabled nri-prometheus prometheus.enabled nri-metadata-injection webhook.enabled kube-state-metrics ksm.enabled nri-kube-events kubeEvents.enabled newrelic-logging logging.enabled Configuring subcharts The nri-bundle chart leverages Helm's subchart configuration mechanism to configure its components. This means that you can supply the configuration values to the individual components of the chart, as listed at the beginning of this section, by prefixing them with the name of the chart. For example, to run the agent in unprivileged mode, you can add --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false to the command above, where newrelic-infrastructure is the name of the sub-chart (as listed at the beginning of the section), and privileged is the configuration value for said chart. Please refer to each of the chart's README and their values.yml to see all available configuration options and their defaults. Helm 2 using newrelic-infrastructure Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy purposes only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Update via Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Get the release name of the newrelic-infrastructure chart: helm list Copy Update the release rerunning the appropriate helm upgrade --install command for your preferred installation method.",

      "body": "Incident workflows (or \"workflows\") is a flexible notification system that works within Applied Intelligence to enhance and enrich alert notifications. Incident workflows use a friendly user interface to build rich notification message templates and customize how, when, and where they’re sent. Tip To use incident workflows and Applied Intelligence, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Incident workflows sends alert events to many destinations in any format, enriched with additional context. The destinations include various notification platforms, like webhooks and Jira. Before being sent to a destination, a notification is enriched with extra information, including from the New Relic database (NRDB). Not only that, workflows creates a two-way connection between your notification platforms and New Relic. All of your alert policies can be grouped into a single incident workflow. Tip Incident workflows are currently in BETA. If you haven't signed up yet, go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI and click Incident Workflows Request access. How it works Workflows are a collection of triggers and actions for alerts incidents. A workflow is a set of instructions that defines enriched notification templates, chooses triggers, and connects to multiple notification platforms: A notification template maps the workflows fields to your notification platform. Triggers are alerts policies that start workflow processes. Actions are operations that execute when workflows trigger. Actions include enriching a notification with extra information or configuring your notification platform to define the notification message format. Each workflow has a single account and uses that account’s conditions for its triggers. When notifications are sent Workflows use the same incidents you defined in your alert policies. In alert policies, incident preferences define how incidents and notifications are created when conditions in the policy are violated. Create or edit a workflow From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. In the left pane, click Incident workflows to open the workflows dashboard. Use the workflows dashboard to create, edit, enable, or disable your workflows. Here’s a basic overview: Add and name the workflow. Select triggers. Enrich your notifications with NRQL. Create notification actions. Test your workflow. Activate your workflow. Step 1. Add and name a workflow When you add a workflow, give it a unique, descriptive name that will help you remember its purpose later. Step 2. Select your triggers An alerts condition defines a violation. Violations are workflow triggers. These violations are either warning or critical thresholds defined in the Alert policy. Tip Each workflow must have at least one trigger. If you select more than one, only one of them needs to be true to trigger the actions that follow. Step 3. Optional: Add NRQL query data to enrich your notifications After you select triggers, enrich your notification data with NRQL queries. The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time. You can save any valid (error free) query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result. You can also query with violation-specific variables; for example {{entity.id}}. An example of a NRQL query you might use to enrich your workflow. NRQL query enrichment examples Here are some examples of how to set up enrichment queries. Check overall Synthetic monitoring health If you're using synthetic monitoring to measure your website, you can define the number of unsuccessful health checks that will trigger a violation. This query lets your site reliability team track your unsuccessful health checks. SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE result != 'SUCCESS' since since 10 minutes FACET monitorName Copy Know when violation-related traffic for an application drops This query tracks the number of transactions on the entity with a condition violation, using the custom variable entity.name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy This query tracks the latest HTTP status code response, filtered by the entity that violated the condition’s threshold: From Transaction select latest(httpResponsepre), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy This query gets the number and ingest time by product running within a Kubernetes pod so you can find a potential remedy: SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago Copy Add custom variables to your query Custom variables are properties you can add to violations when you configure a workflow action. You can get information about the alert, such as condition, violation, and entity, using double curly brackets: {{variable_name}}. To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the WHERE statement of the query. For example, here's a query using an entity.name variable to get the state of an Amazon EC2 instance: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy This query has a single value result (stopped) because it only selects a single field. The entity.name is the entity identifier. You can also use entity.id and any other entity properties like this. Step 4. Create notification actions You can use the monitoring platforms ServiceNow, Atlassian Jira Cloud, and AWS EventBridge with workflows. You can also configure a webhook to other destinations. Every workflow requires at least one notification action. To create an action: Configure the notifier Build the message Test the notifier Configure the notifier To configure your notifier, choose a notification platform, and then configure its destination fields. Click Add an action, and then under Notify your channels, click Add. Choose your notification platform. Complete the destination fields based on your notification platform. To acknowledge and close an alerts incident with Jira or ServiceNow, check Allow two-way integration. For example configurations, see Jira and ServiceNow. Configure your notification message The notification message is delivered to your notification platform. A notification message includes one or more key-value fields. Tip When using Jira and ServiceNow, you must map a workflows field name value to its corresponding field in your notification platform. A field’s value can be any combination of the following: Free text Output enriched with NRQL queries results Output enriched with Custom variables In each notifier, the payload is populated with your query results and some custom variables. You can remove those and add other custom variables, using the # sign. Type # to see a list of available outputs and custom variables. You can also write the custom variables manually: {{enricher_name.result}} is replaced with its result. {{variable_name}} is replaced with the variable’s value. Choose the variable name from a list of common fields or create a custom string. ServiceNow notification message example Optional: Test the notifier Send a notification message to verify that you have a good connection to your platform. A workflow test creates a ticket with placeholders for the final values. You get live results from the NRQL queries used to enrich the notifications, but N/A when referring to violations-related data. This is expected behavior. Updated variables are rendered on your notification platform when a real violation triggers the workflow. These values are part of the violation event. If you use variables as part of the notification message, the variables value uses the variable name (for example, entity.name) as a placeholder. If the notifier test fails, check the following: Make sure to use the proper domain, username, and password/token for your platform. Confirm your destination is live/awake. Make sure to use different names for your notifiers. Notifier configuration examples Here are some examples of specific notifier configurations. Atlassian Jira notifier Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable violation data into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira endpoint Jira API key A user with write permission Optional: Assignee and watchers for the ticket A notification message where every field name of the message has a corresponding field name in the project schema (text field or multi-line text field) An example Jira configuration with two-way notification enabled. AWS EventBridge notifier Use workflows to hook New Relic events into AWS services with EventBridge, Amazon's serverless event bus. Then use EventBridge to deliver notification messages to route data to targets like AWS Lambda, SNS queues, CloudWatch logs, etc. Configure an EventBridge integration: Complete the AWS account ID, the AWS region, the name of the event bus, and the notification message (JSON). Send a test notification, which creates a partner event source in your EventBridge service page. On Partner event sources, select Associate with event bus. The Associate with event bus button. Set an event rule to forward the events to whatever AWS service you need: Select the custom or partner event bus option, and then select the name of the event bus. Choose an AWS service to run when triggered by a workflow. ServiceNow notifier Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable violation data into a new ServiceNow Incidents tickets. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates are mirrored back to New Relic. ServiceNow notifier needs: Notifier name ServiceNow endpoint A user with write permission A workflow notification where every field name has a matching field name in the ServiceNow incident table A comprehensive example of a ServiceNow notification message configuration. Here's what that configuration would look like in ServiceNow: ServiceNow ticket created when testing the above example (populated with text placeholders when testing) Here are some notes about this example: We used ServiceNow’s default field incident configuration, you or your company may have configured additional fields and values. Default configurations: Severity, Impact, Urgency are numeric values 1/2/3 that correspond with High/Medium/Low. State field: new, in progress, on hold, resolved, closed, canceled. The Category and Subcategory fields are text fields with a limited value set. See ServiceNow for more detail. Description, Short-Description, and Work_notes are free text fields and can be enriched as part of the notification message ServiceNow two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic alerts incident state. To enable auto-sync between the ServiceNow incident state and a workflow incident: When you enable two-way integration, changes to ServiceNow incidents will update Alerts' incident state. Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file (which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. After you enable the auto-sync process, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. For any state other than New, the workflow incident state changes to Acknowledged. Webhook notifier Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A channel name The endpoint of the target application Authorization Custom headers (if needed) The notification message Make sure to use valid JSON payloads. As suggested above, type \"#\" to add variables to the payload. This is an example of a webhook configuration you might use. Slack You can use a webhook to send workflows content to Slack. Read Slack documentation on how to set up incoming webhooks. You can send a basic webhook. { “text”: “The {{violation.id}}\\n led to this result:{{enricher.result}} ” } Copy You can also send enriched webhooks. { \"text\": \"Example for larger block example - for {{alert.id}}\", \"blocks\": [ { \"type\": \"section\", \"text\": { \"type\": \"mrkdwn\", \"text\": \"{{alert.description}} - {{alert.threshold}}\" } }, { \"type\": \"section\", \"block_id\": \"section567\", \"text\": { \"type\": \"mrkdwn\", \"text\": \"<https: 72nfswczfve=youtu.be> \\n :star: \\n {{violation.threshold}}\" }, \"accessory\": { \"type\": \"image\", \"image_url\": \"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/13785369.jpg\", \"alt_text\": \"Troubled cat image, or a PNG image for your NRQL chart\" } }, { \"type\": \"section\", \"block_id\": \"section789\", \"fields\": [ { \"type\": \"mrkdwn\", \"text\": \"*bolded text*\" } ] } ] } Copy Microsoft Teams You can use a webhook to send workflows content to Microsoft Teams. Read Microsoft documentation on how to create an incoming webhook. Use your Microsoft Teams URL as the webhook domain name.

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. The New Relic Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing Insights dashboards or New Relic One dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Example use cases The Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. For detailed examples and use cases, see this New Relic blog post. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: New Relic APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents.

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

Notes: Before, there were certain circumstances under which an application would crash without New Relic installed, but wouldn't crash with it. This has been fixed, and applications with New Relic installed now crash consistently. The error tracer is now also considerably simpler. Added a security policy. See the new section in README.md or read SECURITY.md. Future-proofed the MongoDB instrumentation and prevented the module from breaking GridFS. Made a small tweak that should reduce the amount of blocking file I/O done by the module. The module's instrumentation and harvest cycle will now not hold the process open in Node 0.9+. This should make it easier for processes to shut themselves down cleanly with New Relic running. The environment information gatherer will no longer crash if it tries to read a directory where it's expecting a file. Errors thrown during the execution of Express routes or Connect middlewares that were attached to requests that ended in HTTP status codes configured to be ignored by default will now be ignored correctly. Made the module play nicer with Node's REPL. It no longer assumes that an application necessarily has a main module. A few tweaks were made to support the CoolBeans dependency injection framework. Several log messages were demoted to a less chatty level.",

      "body": "Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. Gap filling can help you solve issues caused by lost data points. When gaps are detected between valid data points, we automatically fill those gaps with replacement values, such as the last known values or a static value. Gap filling can prevent alerts from triggering or resolving when they shouldn't. Tip To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this announcement. You can customize loss of signal detection and gap filling using NerdGraph. For example, you can configure how long to wait before considering the signal lost, or what value should be used for filling gaps in the time series. Here are some queries and examples you can use in our NerdGraph API explorer. In this guide we cover the following: Customize loss of signal detection Customize gap filling Customize your loss of signal detection Loss of signal detection opens or closes violations if no data is received after a certain amount of time. For example, if you set the duration of the expiration period to 60 seconds and an integration doesn't seem to send data for more than a minute, a loss of signal violation would be triggered. You can configure the duration of the signal loss and whether to open a violation or close it by using these three fields in NerdGraph: expiration.expirationDuration: How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives at our platform and not on data timestamps. The default is to leave this null, and therefore this wouldn't enable Loss of Signal Detection. expiration.openViolationOnExpiration: If true, a new violation is opened when a signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. expiration.closeViolationsOnExpiration: If true, open violations related to the signal are closed on expiration. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. View loss of signal settings for an existing condition Existing NRQL conditions may have their loss of signal settings already configured. To view the existing condition settings, select the fields under nrqlCondition > expiration: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: NRQL_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } } } } } Copy You should see a result like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlCondition\": { \"expiration\": { \" closeViolationsOnExpiration \": false, \" expirationDuration \": 300, \" openViolationOnExpiration \": true }, \"id\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\", \"name\": \"Any less than - Extrapolation\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"SELECT average(value) FROM AlertsSmokeTestSignals WHERE wave_type IN ('min-max', 'single-gap') FACET wave_type\" } } } } } }, ... Copy Create a new condition with loss of signal settings Let's say that you want to create a new create a NRQL static condition that triggers a loss of signal violation after no data is received for two minutes. You would set expirationDuration to 120 seconds and set openViolationOnExpiration to true, like in the example below. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: [{ threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL }] valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 expiration : { expirationDuration : 120 openViolationOnExpiration : true } } ) { id name } } Copy Update the loss of signal settings of a condition What if you want to update loss of signal parameters for an alert condition? The following mutation allows you to update a NRQL static condition with new expiration values. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID id: YOUR_STATIC_CONDITION_ID condition: { expiration: { closeViolationsOnExpiration : BOOLEAN expirationDuration : DURATION_IN_SECONDS openViolationOnExpiration : BOOLEAN } } ) { id expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } Copy Customize gap filling Gap filling replaces gap values in a time series with either the last value found or a static, arbitrary value of your choice. We fill gaps only after another data point has been received after the gaps in signal (after data reception has been restored). You can configure both the type of filling and the value, if the type is set to static: signal.fillOption: Type of replacement value for lost data points. Values can be: NONE: Gap filling is disabled. LAST_VALUE: The last value seen in the time series. STATIC: An arbitrary value, defined in fillValue. signal.fillValue: Value to use for replacing lost data points when fillOption is set to STATIC. Important Gap filling is also affected by expiration.expirationDuration. When a gap is longer than the expiration duration, the signal is considered expired and the gap will no longer be filled. For example, here's how to create a static NRQL condition with gap filling configured: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { enabled: true name: \"Example Gap Filling Condition\" nrql: { query: \"select count(*) from Transaction\" } terms: { operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL threshold: 1000 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 28800 signal: { aggregationWindow: 60, evaluationOffset: 3, fillOption: STATIC, fillValue: 1 } } ) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month.

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Here are the available aggregator functions. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT unique(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "New Relic's query language, NRQL, has rate limits in place to ensure a high level of availability and reliability for all users. To understand the places NRQL can be used, see Where is NRQL used?. You will rarely encounter rate limiting, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) that run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. Limits on queried events When you run a NRQL query, it will display the number of events inspected, as shown below: In this context, \"events\" is used in a general sense to refer to all NRQL-available objects; this includes events, metrics, logs, and distributed tracing (span) data. Each New Relic account has limits on the total number of events that can be inspected. There are limits that apply over two different time frames: A rolling 30-minute time window A 24-hour period These limits are as follows: Time period Limit Rolling 30 minutes 300 billion events inspected (equivalent to a sustained rate of 10 billion events inspected per minute) 24 hours 7.2 trillion events inspected Once the limit has been reached for a given time period, limiting will be imposed and some queries may be impacted. After the time period has passed, if query volume drops below the limit, restrictions will be removed automatically. NRQL query rate limits The limit on NRQL queries is 50 queries per second, or 3000 queries per minute. Past this, New Relic cannot guarantee query performance, and you may be rate limited. Limits on count of data types The limit for total number of reported data types is 250 per account over a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. This limit applies to all NRQL-queryable data types. Because there aren't that many different data types reported by New Relic products and integrations, this will mainly be a limit on custom events.",

DistributedTraceSummary Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Events category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrUsage consumption count The amount of consumption converted to the unit of pricing. For example, for Data Platform, consumption is equal to GigabytesIngested. For Full Stack Observability, consumption is equal to FullUsers. This attribute is useful if you want to see consumption faceted by productLine or other attribute. NrConsumption NrMTDConsumption estimatedCost count A cost estimate based on consumption and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs, not your invoice amount. NrConsumption NrMTDConsumption masterAccountId ID The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrUsage metric enum Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. NrConsumption NrMTDConsumption NrUsage month The month and year during which the consumption occurred, expressed by the month spelled out and the year in the format yyyy. Example: August 2020 NrConsumption NrMTDConsumption monthTimestamp The timestamp of the month during which the consumption occurred. NrConsumption NrMTDConsumption productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Use this attribute to identify / filter for product specific usage data. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated.

For example, GigabytesIngested consumption may be made up of ApmEventBytes, BrowserEventBytes, CustomEventBytes and other NrUsage metrics. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage Data source : Account Usage Once per day, New Relic products generate a NrDailyUsage Insights event. Use the productLine attribute to identify and filter for the specific product's usage. Attribute name Definition Events agentHostname ID ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application's environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. NrDailyUsage apmAgentMemoryBytes bytes (B) Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. NrDailyUsage apmAgentProcessorCount count Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS.

Present only for events where usageType equals Application. NrDailyUsage apmAppInstanceId ID ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). NrDailyUsage apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. NrDailyUsage apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). NrDailyUsage apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes bytes (B) Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host's instance type. NrDailyUsage apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount count Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host's instance type. NrDailyUsage apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. NrDailyUsage apmComputeUnits count Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. NrDailyUsage apmContainerCount count The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. NrDailyUsage apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: `apmHoursUsed / 750`. NrDailyUsage apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. NrDailyUsage apmMemoryBytes bytes (B) Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize.

Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. NrDailyUsage browserAppId ID ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. Deprecated. NrDailyUsage browserPageViewCount count Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation. Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. NrDailyUsage cloudInstanceId ID ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. NrDailyUsage cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes. This is calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. NrDailyUsage cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. NrDailyUsage cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. NrDailyUsage cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. NrDailyUsage consumingAccountId ID ID of the New Relic account that's directly responsible for the stored data, as determined from the license key. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrUsage consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account directly responsible for the stored data, as determined from the license key. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrUsage containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. NrDailyUsage hostId ID ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. NrDailyUsage infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes bytes (B) Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. NrDailyUsage infrastructureAgentProcessorCount count Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. NrDailyUsage infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. NrDailyUsage infrastructureBillingInstanceSize gibibyte (Gib) Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in gibibytes (GiB). NrDailyUsage infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes bytes (B) Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. NrDailyUsage infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount count Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. NrDailyUsage infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. NrDailyUsage infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see Compute unit pricing. NrDailyUsage infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. NrDailyUsage insightsEventNamespace The type of event. For example: Transaction, MobileCrash, or SystemSample. Event namespaces are associated with a specific data retention period. NrDailyUsage insightsIncludedEventCount count Count of all events of the given insightsEventNamespace stored for the retention period included with a paid non-Insights product subscription. For example, APM Pro subscriptions include several days' retention of Transaction events. This attribute represents a count of events existing in storage as measured on a given day, and not a count of the events added to storage during a given day. Summing this attribute over a period of more than a day may not give you what you expect; for example, it will not yield the total volume of events written to storage in that period. NrDailyUsage insightsIncludedRetentionInHours Number of hours for which events of the given insightsEventNamespace are stored but are not counted toward your paid Insights Pro subscription. For more information about the data reported in nrDailyUsage, see Insights usage: Attributes and queries. NrDailyUsage insightsNrProduct New Relic product (Insights, APM, Browser, Mobile, etc.) that corresponds to the given insightsEventNamespace. NrDailyUsage insightsTotalEventCount count Count of all events stored for the given insightsEventNamespace as of the given day. Sum of insightsIncludedEventCount and the number of events stored beyond the retention period included with a paid non-Insights product subscription. This attribute represents a count of events existing in storage as measured on a given day, and not a count of the events added to storage during a given day. Summing this attribute over a period of more than a day may not give you what you expect; for example, it will not yield the total volume of events written to storage in that period. NrDailyUsage insightsTotalRetentionInHours Number of hours for which events of the given insightsEventNamespace are stored. NrDailyUsage instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. NrDailyUsage isPrimaryApp Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. Deprecated. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple names for an app. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. NrDailyUsage masterAccountId ID The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrUsage missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. NrDailyUsage missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count.

Use this attribute to identify / filter for product specific usage data. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage subAccountId ID ID of the sub-account responsible for the stored event. When present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). NrDailyUsage NrUsage subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). NrDailyUsage NrUsage syntheticsFailedCheckCount count Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. NrDailyUsage syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. NrDailyUsage syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. For more information about the data reported in nrDailyUsage, see Insights usage: Attributes and queries. NrDailyUsage syntheticsMonitorId ID Unique ID of the monitor. NrDailyUsage syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. NrDailyUsage syntheticsSuccessCheckCount count Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location.

Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. NrDailyUsage timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. NrDailyUsage NrIntegrationError Data source : Account Usage The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Attribute name Definition Events apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. NrIntegrationError category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. NrIntegrationError httpResponseCode enum The HTTP response code associated with the transaction. NrIntegrationError Transaction TransactionError message Contents of the error message. NrIntegrationError name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException.

As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) will not receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users for New Relic accounts with SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Admin user's API keys for all users that go into a pending state will be deleted. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Important These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Master and sub-accounts If your account has sub-accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the master level only. The sub-account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the master account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner.

Currently New Relic doesn't leverage the application name for Lambda invocations. The agent now defaults the application name in serverless mode to remove the requirement of end-user configuration while handling cases if it were to be leveraged in the future. Improved clarity of logging between 'no log file' or disabled agent startup issues. Logs no-config file error to initialized logger (stdout) in addition to existing console.error() logging. Adds specific message to no config file separate from being disabled. Stopped binding/propagating segments via setImmediate for ended transactions. Bumped @grpc/grpc-js to ^1.2.7. Added support metric to be able to track usage of cert bundle via usage of custom certificates. Fixes Fixed bug where agent would attempt to call the 'preconnect' endpoint on the redirect host returned by the previous 'preconnect' call when reconnecting to the New Relic servers. The 'preconnect' calls now always use the original agent configuration value. Subsequent endpoints (connect, harvest endpoints, etc.) will continue to leverage the new redirect host value returned by 'preconnect.' The original config values are no longer overridden. Fixed issue where a call to transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders would throw an error when the headers parameter is a string. Removed index-bad-config test which tested a no-longer possible use-case. Removed license-key test logic from serverless-harvest test. Serverless mode does not require a license key as data transfer is handled by the integration. Removed aws-sdk versioned test filtering. Removed unused Travis CI scripts. Support statement: New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and pricing tiers. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher Windows: Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. OpenSSL library 1.1.0 (or higher) is a requirement for infra-agent v1.16.4 or higher. Operating systems previous to year 2016 (like Suse12 or CentOS7) need to update OpenSSL from 1.0. to 1.1.. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "This document details how to instrument third-party gems with the Ruby agent, as well as some best practices for interacting with the agent. This is useful if you are using a gem that the Ruby agent does not instrument by default, or if you are a gem author who wants to add instrumentation for your library. Contents Finding third-party extensions Anyone can write a gem that builds on top of the Ruby agent. New Relic maintains a repository called extends_newrelic_rpm to track these extensions and to provide links to other gems that build the Ruby agent. These extensions are not supported by New Relic. New Relic gathers these links as a service to our customers. Issues with those gems should be reported to the respective projects on GitHub. Extensions as gems New Relic encourages third-party extensions to be maintained as gems, with one gem per instrumented library. For example, newrelic-redis provides instrumentation for the redis gem. Starting transactions If your library provides code which should be represented as a full transaction in New Relic (for example: a web request or background job that isn't instrumented by the Ruby agent), then use one of these mechanisms for starting a transaction. add_transaction_tracer The simplest way to get a transaction started is to call add_transaction_tracer on the method. This assumes that NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation is included in your class. class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy perform_action_with_newrelic_trace Sometimes you need slightly more control over the transaction that New Relic generates. When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",

Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in New Relic APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"tdp\": { \"title\": \"Telemetry Data Platform\", \"description\": \"Ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Telemetry Data Platform\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. tdp: title: Telemetry Data Platform description: Ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. tiles: - /docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/get-started-telemetry-data-platform Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR.",

Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The Docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the Docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple: <table> <thead> <tr> <th width={200}> **Item** </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Some thing </td> <td> More detailed information about it </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Another thing </td> <td> More detailed information about another thing </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens --- to create each column’s header, and pipes | to separate each column.

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Project Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list service.usage.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that tier). Basic users are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free tier. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. The Standard tier of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing tier, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization). One full user, and unlimited basic users. Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. 100M Proactive Detection app transactions and 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

This agent leverages the amp-analytics agent to define the relevant New Relic events and send them to New Relic to be captured for reporting. Compatibility and requirements This private beta is closed. This feature and all related services will be deprecated in July 2021. In addition to browser monitoring's installation requirements, Browser's AMP agent requires: Browser AMP requirements Comments New Relic Browser New Relic's browser requirements include Browser Pro account, which includes access to New Relic Insights data depending on your Browser subscription level. Browser app ID To capture AMP throughput, browser monitoring needs the app ID for each app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser and select an application from the index. Copy the numeric value that follows /browser/1234567890 in the URL. Browser monitoring license key To obtain only the browser monitoring license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key (just above the ending </script> tag), and save. Install Browser's AMP agent New Relic has partnered with The Amp Project to incorporate New Relic Browser's AMP agent in with the AMP Analytics repo. Before installing, read the requirements. To install the Browser AMP agent into your AMP app: Add the attribute newrelic to your AMP analytics code. For more information, see the AMP site. Add the browser app ID and license key. To send data from one AMP page to multiple Browser apps, include quote marks and a comma to separate each Browser app ID. For example: \"appId\": [\"123\", \"124\", \"125\"] <amp-analytics type=\"newrelic\" id=\"newrelic\"> <script type=\"application/json\"> { \"vars\": { \"appId\": \"\", \"licenseKey\": \"\" } } </script> </amp-analytics> Copy Query AMP events Currently, your AMP data will not appear in the New Relic's browser monitoring UI. This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your browser monitoring metrics. In the meantime, you can run NRQL queries to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics. New Relic stores AMP events in the PageView and BrowserInteraction events. To view the AMP events, run the following NRQL queries: SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' Here's an example of a dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data apps are collections of linked dashboards that create a curated, application-like experience. Even users who do not know NRQL can explore your business data with data apps. For example, with data apps and custom attributes, your support department could easily check how often an individual account or user accesses a particular feature of your app. Create a data app Important We have an improved way to build dashboards with multiple pages in New Relic One. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. To create a new data app: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > Create a data app. Specify an Icon, Title, URL, Description, and Permissions for your app. Select Create to save your new data app. After creating your app, customize it with new or existing dashboards from your account. Add dashboards to your data app After creating your data app, Insights automatically redirects to a new dashboard. You can add widgets to this dashboard using standard NRQL queries. You can also create additional dashboards by selecting + Add from the data app navigation bar, or copy an existing dashboard into your data app: From your data app dashboard, select Edit, then select Configure data app. Select the Copy dropdown, and choose a dashboard. Copied dashboards are independent of the original dashboard. Changes to the original dashboard do not affect the copy, and editing or deleting the copied dashboard does not affect the original. Link between dashboards with FACETs This feature has been improved in New Relic One dashboards. For details, see Filter by facets. You can use the FACET widget to link to a pre-filtered dashboard. Creating links allows your users to navigate between dashboards in an intuitive way. For example, you could link a faceted list of most-active users to another dashboard. Clicking a username in the first dashboard opens the linked dashboard and filters it to show only metrics from that user account. To create a link: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > (select a data app). Select the dashboard containing the widget you want to link from, then select Edit. From the widget you want to link, select the link icon. Select the target dashboard from the list. Manage dashboards in data apps After creating a dashboard, you can manage the order in which your dashboards appear in the data app's navigation bar. You can also hide certain dashboards if you only want to link to that dashboard, but not have it clutter the navigation bar. To manage dashboards, edit the settings for your app: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > (select a data app). Select Edit > Configure data app. Mouse over an individual dashboard to view the management tools and make your changes. When finished, select the X icon or click anywhere outside the dialog box to save your changes automatically. The following dashboard management options are available: Option Description Reorder dashboards Mouse over the dashboard in the list and select the up or down arrow icons to reorder the navigation bar. Set primary dashboard The first dashboard in the list is the primary dashboard. Whenever a user selects your data app, this is be the first dashboard they see. To change the primary dashboard, use the reorder arrows to move it to the top of the dashboard list. Hide or unhide a dashboard Select the eye icon to hide a dashboard from the data app's navigation bar. You can still link to this dashboard with FACET widgets, but the dashboard is otherwise invisible to data app users. This allows you to have many dashboards in your app without cluttering the navigation bar. Select the eye icon again to unhide the dashboard. Delete a dashboard Select the delete icon to remove a dashboard from your data app. This permanently removes the dashboard and all its widgets. If the dashboard was copied from another dashboard, the original dashboard will not be deleted. Change data app settings To edit the settings for an existing data app: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > (select a data app) > Edit. Select Configure data app, then make your changes. When finished, select the X icon or click anywhere outside the dialog box to save your changes automatically. The following settings are available: Option Description Icon Select an icon to quickly identify a particular data app. Title Specify a name for your app. URL Specify a custom URL for your app. This setting is not available when configuring an existing app, only when creating a new data app. Description Specify a description for your app, which allows you to summarize the app for other account users. Permissions There are three levels of sharing permissions for data apps: Private just to me: Most secure option Viewable by others in my account Editable by others in my account: Default option Show query bar Hide or show the query bar when using the data app. Hiding the query bar gives your users a more curated, application-like experience. This setting is not available when creating a new data app, only when configuring an existing app. Delete the app To permanently delete the data app and all of its dashboards, select the trash can icon.",

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. The newer model offers a much simpler, more efficient way to manage users and what they have access to (learn more about the benefits of the new model). At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and our existing customers' users remained on our original user model. Now some of our original-model customers can use a migration wizard in the UI to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Requirements The easiest way to see if you have access to the user migration wizard is to check if it’s visible in the UI. Factors affecting access to the migration wizard: You must have the Owner role. The migration wizard is not available for some organizations that have a more complex account structure. If the migration wizard is not available and you wish to migrate your users, contact your New Relic account representative. Before beginning The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first understand our new user management concepts. A brief summary: Users reside within a container known as an “authentication domain,” which governs how those users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI vs. automatically with a SCIM-based identity provider), and how they log in (manually with email/password vs. using SAML SSO), and other settings. Typically organizations have just one or two domains: one with the default manual settings and one for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often in multiple groups. When you want to add new groups, or give groups access to more accounts, you must create an access grant. This assigns a group access to: 1) a specific role and 2) a specific account. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role (a role being a custom set of capabilities). The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first plan out how your user groups and access grants will be structured. Use the user migration wizard If you meet the requirements, you can use the wizard. To start using the migration wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation and then click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: if you have problems, see Tips. Once your users are migrated to the new model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs. full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs. Tips on using the migration wizard The migration wizard is meant to have all the context you need to complete the migration process but here are some tips for potential areas of confusion: Guided setup vs. automatic setup: Simple organizations with few users and few accounts, and who have little need for users to have separate roles or separate account access, may decide to choose the automatic setup. If you require some user access customization, or if your users use SAML SSO to sign in or are managed via an identity service provider (like Okta), use the guided setup. Once an account’s Owner does the initial step in the wizard of migrating admins, those admins are then able to access and complete the remainder of the migration wizard. The migration wizard gives you an option to download a full list of your existing original user model users (aka v1 users) before choosing to migrate users. We recommend downloading that file because it can serve as a useful reference and, in case it’s needed, as a backup file. To check on the status of your user migration, you can go to the User management UI to see which users are on the new model. After migration, some users may end up with access to logins for both an original model account and a new model account, both associated with a single email address. This is because our original user model allowed a user, with a single login, to access data from multiple organizations (a common scenario for contractors, for example). But the new user model gives more user control to organizations, and this means that these users now need a different login for each organization. If a user previously had access that spanned multiple organizations, they retain an original user record until migration is completed for all associated organizations. When a user has an email address associated with multiple logins, they'll be asked to verify their email. If your email address is associated with multiple logins, you can verify your email to see those accounts. In the example above, the “Original New Relic account” refers to that user record being on the older, original account/user model.",

DistributedTraceSummary Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Events category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

For example, APM Pro subscriptions include several days' retention of Transaction events. This attribute represents a count of events existing in storage as measured on a given day, and not a count of the events added to storage during a given day. Summing this attribute over a period of more than a day may not give you what you expect; for example, it will not yield the total volume of events written to storage in that period. NrDailyUsage insightsIncludedRetentionInHours Number of hours for which events of the given insightsEventNamespace are stored but are not counted toward your paid Insights Pro subscription. For more information about the data reported in nrDailyUsage, see Insights usage: Attributes and queries.

NrDailyUsage insightsTotalEventCount count Count of all events stored for the given insightsEventNamespace as of the given day. Sum of insightsIncludedEventCount and the number of events stored beyond the retention period included with a paid non-Insights product subscription. This attribute represents a count of events existing in storage as measured on a given day, and not a count of the events added to storage during a given day. Summing this attribute over a period of more than a day may not give you what you expect; for example, it will not yield the total volume of events written to storage in that period. NrDailyUsage insightsTotalRetentionInHours Number of hours for which events of the given insightsEventNamespace are stored. NrDailyUsage instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. NrDailyUsage isPrimaryApp Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. Deprecated. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple names for an app. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. NrDailyUsage masterAccountId ID The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account.

Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Types of Synthetics monitors. NrDailyUsage syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. NrDailyUsage timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. NrConsumption NrDailyUsage NrMTDConsumption NrUsage usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. NrDailyUsage NrIntegrationError Data source : Account Usage The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Attribute name Definition Events apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. NrIntegrationError category The category of the error.

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "Important For an even better experience than plugins, go to: newrelic.com/integrations: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform. developer.newrelic.com: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs. Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Plugin summary metrics Each component or instance for your plugin in Plugin Central can have summary metrics, such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count. The summary metrics appear on your plugin's Summary page in the Plugins user interface. The summary metric dashboards are also useful as a debugging tool to review all of the metrics sent by your plugin agent to New Relic. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select any summary metric value for it. You can also change various plugin settings in the UI. When you first create a summary metric for your plugin, this triggers a change to New Relic's collectors. This may cause your running components (instances) to stop showing summary metrics for a short period of time. For example, if you add a new summary metric to your plugin, any components (instances) you are monitoring that use that plugin may have all summary metrics temporarily cleared. This will also close any outstanding related events and alerts. Depending on the components and other factors, you may need to wait fifteen minutes or more before summary metrics appear again. Add summary metrics To add a summary metric: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. From the Summary metrics section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. If your plugin contains only one summary metric, you can identify the metric in the chart's title and then hide the legend (colored bars that label the metrics) that normally appears below the chart. Also, if you define negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Optional: Add alert summary metrics Plugin publishers and users can define alert conditions from the plugin's Summary page by selecting the component's or instance's settings icon. The alerts will be activated when the summary metric's specified values fall above the thresholds. The Recent events list for the plugin's components (instances) appears on the plugin's Summary page. To view additional details about an alert, select its name. Sometimes there may be a delay between the time that a summary metric event is triggered and the time that New Relic creates the corresponding incident and sends the alert notification. There are several timing mechanisms at work, such as collector caching, summary metric event timing, delayed job queues, email delivery, etc. Depending on the situation, this delay could be up to ten or fifteen minutes before the alert notification is sent. Time periods for metrics Metrics that appear in dashboards are reported with a duration. The end time is implied by the time New Relic receives the metrics. This is why you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting. The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show various time periods. You can also deliver data at one-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, New Relic aggregates when there is too much data, but it does not extrapolate if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30-minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear. Recommendation: Use a 60-second polling interval. Default dashboards show 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Plugin dashboards You can create dashboards to visualize the data generated by your plugins in New Relic. You must be a plugin author or publisher to add, edit, and delete dashboards. Plugin users cannot customize the plugin dashboards they acquire from Plugin Central. View the default dashboard New plugins automatically include a default dashboard. Once your plugin agent starts sending data to New Relic's Plugin API, you can view the default dashboard in New Relic's UI and change it as needed. To view the default dashboard for your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select a component (instance). Add dashboards In addition to the default dashboard, you can create as many additional dashboards for your plugin as you want. After you publish your plugin, all of these dashboards and summary metrics are available to plugin users. The customized dashboards that display plugin data are part of the plugin. Plugin users cannot add their own dashboards. This needs to be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin fork or update. To create additional dashboards: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. From the Dashboards section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. Specify a title for your dashboard, select a page layout, then select Create. From the new dashboard page, type a label for the new chart or table, and then select Add chart or table. Edit the chart, including the case-sensitive metrics (for example, a metric name you see in the agent output, such as Component/SIN[Value]) and value (for example, Total value). To use additional options (for example, number format), select Advanced options. Optional: Use a wildcard (*) to show multiple metrics on a chart. For example, to include the metric component/foo/bar and the metric component/foo/xyz, use the metric name component/foo/*.f Select Save and Preview to preview the chart or table. Or, select Save and finish when you are satisfied with the appearance of the chart or table. Review the new chart that appears on the customized dashboard, and continue adding, editing, or rearranging charts and tables on your dashboard as needed. When finished, select I'm done editing. Avoid metric grouping problems Wildcards provide flexibility for how your metric names appear. When creating a chart, consider whether you want the metric names to appear with identical namespace segments, or include a wildcard to strip the namespace segments. For example: Component/Database/Metric1 Component/Database/Metric2 Component/Database/Metric3 Copy OR Metric1 Metric2 Metric3 Copy To prevent problems with metric grouping issues, avoid defining values that result in excessively large numbers. For example, if a plugin's chart value is 1 widget and New Relic collects 3 million widgets, change the value to 1 million widgets so that the chart can show millions of widgets more efficiently. Also, avoid creating high-precision values containing many digits after a decimal point. Change or delete dashboards To update or remove any plugin dashboard, including the default: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. Keep a stable production version of your plugin that users can acquire from Plugin Central, and create a development version that you are actively improving, testing, browsing the presentation of metrics on your custom dashboard, or otherwise have in a non-production state. Plugin settings You can change several plugin settings before you publish the plugin. You can also make changes at any time to published plugins. Initial settings Before you publish your plugin, you can: Select a generic plugin icon for the Plugins UI. This is not the same as the URL for your customized branding image you may choose as part of the publishing process. Change your plugin's label for the Plugins UI. By default, this is the first 11 characters of the plugin's Title field. Change your plugin's title. The default title is your plugin's GUID. Add, change, or delete your plugin's summary metrics and their alert conditions. Add, change, or delete your plugin's dashboards. Exception: You can edit but you cannnot delete your plugin's default dashboard. To add, change, or delete plugin settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. When finished, be sure to save your changes. Additional updates After you publish your plugin, you can continue making changes. Recommendation: To avoid development and testing impacts on your users, maintain development and production versions. To make additional updates to your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From your plugin's Summary page, select Edit, Publish, or your component's (instance's) settings icon as applicable. Update the settings as needed, and then save your changes. When you are ready to release this version: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, select your plugin, and then select Publish. Here is a summary of where to view or make changes to your plugin. Type of change Edit Publish Settings Agent: Change the plugin's version (n/a in UI). Alert conditions, customized for components (instances) Alert conditions, defaults for summary metrics Branding image (URL) that appears in Plugin Central Components (instances): Remove from your plugin Dashboards: Add, edit, delete Description Developer Terms of Service Icon that appears in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (label) in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (title) in Plugin Central NPI Compatible designation Publisher's name Summary metrics: Add, edit, delete URL for installation and setup instructions URL for your support site URL for your website (\"About us\")",

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Kubernetes installation with Helm. To install the integration using manifests, see Kubernetes integration: install and configure. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Start the installer Compatibility and requirements Our Helm chart is compatible with both Helm 2 and 3. Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Follow the instructions for your version of Helm: Helm 3 using nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to Logs. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Automatically injects metadata in applications deployed to the cluster to correlate APM monitoring with Infrastructure monitoring. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, allows to scrape Prometheus endpoints and report metrics to New Relic. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics for you if needed. We recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it provides the easiest way to select, install, and upgrade individual components at your will. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent isn't installed. helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy You can flip the ksm.enabled flag to true if KSM isn't already present in your cluster. Install the Kubernetes integration: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Configuring nri-bundle with Helm Enabling and disabling subcharts The nri-bundle chart pulls the following dependencies, if the corresponding flags are enabled: Subchart Flag newrelic-infrastructure infrastructure.enabled nri-prometheus prometheus.enabled nri-metadata-injection webhook.enabled kube-state-metrics ksm.enabled nri-kube-events kubeEvents.enabled newrelic-logging logging.enabled Configuring subcharts The nri-bundle chart leverages Helm's subchart configuration mechanism to configure its components. This means that you can supply the configuration values to the individual components of the chart, as listed at the beginning of this section, by prefixing them with the name of the chart. For example, to run the agent in unprivileged mode, you can add --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false to the command above, where newrelic-infrastructure is the name of the sub-chart (as listed at the beginning of the section), and privileged is the configuration value for said chart. Please refer to each of the chart's README and their values.yml to see all available configuration options and their defaults. Helm 2 using newrelic-infrastructure Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy purposes only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Update via Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Get the release name of the newrelic-infrastructure chart: helm list Copy Update the release rerunning the appropriate helm upgrade --install command for your preferred installation method.",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

Requirements Agent version nr-1016 or higher. Description In Browser monitoring, a release is a way to tag errors with information about what version of your application is currently running. This is useful for sites where shared components are owned by different teams, or multiple applications are deployed independently but run on the same page. Modern web applications have many interconnecting parts, so an application may have multiple releases (with different names) associated with the same page load. For example, you can use releases to: See differences between errors from an old cached version of your app and errors coming from a new version. Identify problems found during A/B testing, slow rollouts, feature flags, and other advanced deployment methods. Determine which version of a Browser source map to use. If the URL for your JavaScript is not unique, you must specify a release name and identifier with this API call to the Browser agent. This information is also required when publishing source maps to the storage service. This API adds an ID for Browser to identify releases with multiple JavaScript bundles on the same page. If the URL for your app's JavaScript bundle is unique each time you deploy your code, Browser does not require any additional information to identify your release. For example, some front end deployment tools use the Jenkins build number or git commit sha in the filename of the deployed code. These are enough to uniquely determine the release that caused the error. As soon as possible after your page loads, call newrelic.addRelease(). All errors that the Browser agent sees will be associated with that version of the JavaScript code. Parameters Parameter Description $release_name string Required. A short description of the component; for example, the name of a project, application, file, or library. $release_id string Required. The ID or version of this release; for example, a version number, build number from your CI environment, GitHub SHA, GUID, or a hash of the contents. Since New Relic converts this value into a string, you can also use null or undefined if necessary. The $release_name and $release_id combination must be unique; for example: 'signup', '2.4.0' 'signup', '2.4.1' However, you can use the same version for different components; for example: 'signup', '2.4.0' 'logout', '2.4.0' Examples Current short SHA newrelic.addRelease('checkout page', 'a818994') Copy Semantic versioning newrelic.addRelease('jquery.min.js', 'v3.1.1') Copy",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Currently the patterns feature is opt-in; if you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, contact your account representative and ask to have it enabled. There will be up to a 24 hour lead time before the machine learning (ML) system generates a customized model for your account. Patterns will be available for all customers to enable or disable on demand at the end of April 2021. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore patterns and logs with no pattern By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs With No Pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs With No Pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Why don't I see Pattern data? The following are a few reasons why you might have Patterns enabled but not have any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, please contact support. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since Patterns was enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a \"message\" field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the \"message\" field of a log record. If your logs don't contain \"message,\" there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with, log patterns such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Limited access to legacy plugins As of December 2, 2020, plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Plugin summary metrics Each component or instance for your plugin in Plugin Central can have summary metrics, such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count. The summary metrics appear on your plugin's Summary page in the Plugins user interface. The summary metric dashboards are also useful as a debugging tool to review all of the metrics sent by your plugin agent to New Relic. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select any summary metric value for it. You can also change various plugin settings in the UI. When you first create a summary metric for your plugin, this triggers a change to New Relic's collectors. This may cause your running components (instances) to stop showing summary metrics for a short period of time. For example, if you add a new summary metric to your plugin, any components (instances) you are monitoring that use that plugin may have all summary metrics temporarily cleared. This will also close any outstanding related events and alerts. Depending on the components and other factors, you may need to wait fifteen minutes or more before summary metrics appear again. Add summary metrics To add a summary metric: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. From the Summary metrics section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. If your plugin contains only one summary metric, you can identify the metric in the chart's title and then hide the legend (colored bars that label the metrics) that normally appears below the chart. Also, if you define negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values. Optional: Add alert summary metrics Plugin publishers and users can define alert conditions from the plugin's Summary page by selecting the component's or instance's settings icon. The alerts will be activated when the summary metric's specified values fall above the thresholds. The Recent events list for the plugin's components (instances) appears on the plugin's Summary page. To view additional details about an alert, select its name. Sometimes there may be a delay between the time that a summary metric event is triggered and the time that New Relic creates the corresponding incident and sends the alert notification. There are several timing mechanisms at work, such as collector caching, summary metric event timing, delayed job queues, email delivery, etc. Depending on the situation, this delay could be up to ten or fifteen minutes before the alert notification is sent. Time periods for metrics Metrics that appear in dashboards are reported with a duration. The end time is implied by the time New Relic receives the metrics. This is why you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past. The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting. The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show various time periods. You can also deliver data at one-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, New Relic aggregates when there is too much data, but it does not extrapolate if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30-minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear. Recommendation: Use a 60-second polling interval. Default dashboards show 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24 * 3=72 data points for your chart. Plugin dashboards You can create dashboards to visualize the data generated by your plugins in New Relic. You must be a plugin author or publisher to add, edit, and delete dashboards. Plugin users cannot customize the plugin dashboards they acquire from Plugin Central. View the default dashboard New plugins automatically include a default dashboard. Once your plugin agent starts sending data to New Relic's Plugin API, you can view the default dashboard in New Relic's UI and change it as needed. To view the default dashboard for your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select a component (instance). Add dashboards In addition to the default dashboard, you can create as many additional dashboards for your plugin as you want. After you publish your plugin, all of these dashboards and summary metrics are available to plugin users. The customized dashboards that display plugin data are part of the plugin. Plugin users cannot add their own dashboards. This needs to be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin fork or update. To create additional dashboards: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. From the Dashboards section of the plugin's editing page, select Add. Specify a title for your dashboard, select a page layout, then select Create. From the new dashboard page, type a label for the new chart or table, and then select Add chart or table. Edit the chart, including the case-sensitive metrics (for example, a metric name you see in the agent output, such as Component/SIN[Value]) and value (for example, Total value). To use additional options (for example, number format), select Advanced options. Optional: Use a wildcard (*) to show multiple metrics on a chart. For example, to include the metric component/foo/bar and the metric component/foo/xyz, use the metric name component/foo/*.f Select Save and Preview to preview the chart or table. Or, select Save and finish when you are satisfied with the appearance of the chart or table. Review the new chart that appears on the customized dashboard, and continue adding, editing, or rearranging charts and tables on your dashboard as needed. When finished, select I'm done editing. Avoid metric grouping problems Wildcards provide flexibility for how your metric names appear. When creating a chart, consider whether you want the metric names to appear with identical namespace segments, or include a wildcard to strip the namespace segments. For example: Component/Database/Metric1 Component/Database/Metric2 Component/Database/Metric3 Copy OR Metric1 Metric2 Metric3 Copy To prevent problems with metric grouping issues, avoid defining values that result in excessively large numbers. For example, if a plugin's chart value is 1 widget and New Relic collects 3 million widgets, change the value to 1 million widgets so that the chart can show millions of widgets more efficiently. Also, avoid creating high-precision values containing many digits after a decimal point. Change or delete dashboards To update or remove any plugin dashboard, including the default: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, select Edit. Keep a stable production version of your plugin that users can acquire from Plugin Central, and create a development version that you are actively improving, testing, browsing the presentation of metrics on your custom dashboard, or otherwise have in a non-production state. Plugin settings You can change several plugin settings before you publish the plugin. You can also make changes at any time to published plugins. Initial settings Before you publish your plugin, you can: Select a generic plugin icon for the Plugins UI. This is not the same as the URL for your customized branding image you may choose as part of the publishing process. Change your plugin's label for the Plugins UI. By default, this is the first 11 characters of the plugin's Title field. Change your plugin's title. The default title is your plugin's GUID. Add, change, or delete your plugin's summary metrics and their alert conditions. Add, change, or delete your plugin's dashboards. Exception: You can edit but you cannnot delete your plugin's default dashboard. To add, change, or delete plugin settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's Summary page, select Edit. When finished, be sure to save your changes. Additional updates After you publish your plugin, you can continue making changes. Recommendation: To avoid development and testing impacts on your users, maintain development and production versions. To make additional updates to your plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From your plugin's Summary page, select Edit, Publish, or your component's (instance's) settings icon as applicable. Update the settings as needed, and then save your changes. When you are ready to release this version: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, select your plugin, and then select Publish. Here is a summary of where to view or make changes to your plugin. Type of change Edit Publish Settings Agent: Change the plugin's version (n/a in UI). Alert conditions, customized for components (instances) Alert conditions, defaults for summary metrics Branding image (URL) that appears in Plugin Central Components (instances): Remove from your plugin Dashboards: Add, edit, delete Description Developer Terms of Service Icon that appears in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (label) in the Plugins UI Name for plugin (title) in Plugin Central NPI Compatible designation Publisher's name Summary metrics: Add, edit, delete URL for installation and setup instructions URL for your support site URL for your website (\"About us\")",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Tip To use Incident Intelligence and Applied Intelligence, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these four steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per master account and its sub-accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one master account. Need to change the environment's associated account? Reach out to your account executive or our support team for help. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. PagerDuty You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Tip Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can also set PagerDuty as a destination, as well as any other destination compatible with webhook: Send data to PagerDuty Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month.

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Here are the available aggregator functions. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT unique(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. Limits on queried events When you run a NRQL query, it will display the number of events inspected, as shown below: In this context, \"events\" is used in a general sense to refer to all NRQL-available objects; this includes events, metrics, logs, and distributed tracing (span) data. Each New Relic account has limits on the total number of events that can be inspected. There are limits that apply over two different time frames: A rolling 30-minute time window A 24-hour period These limits are as follows: Time period Limit Rolling 30 minutes 300 billion events inspected (equivalent to a sustained rate of 10 billion events inspected per minute) 24 hours 7.2 trillion events inspected Once the limit has been reached for a given time period, limiting will be imposed and some queries may be impacted. After the time period has passed, if query volume drops below the limit, restrictions will be removed automatically. NRQL query rate limits The limit on NRQL queries is 50 queries per second, or 3000 queries per minute. Past this, New Relic cannot guarantee query performance, and you may be rate limited. Limits on count of data types The limit for total number of reported data types is 250 per account over a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. This limit applies to all NRQL-queryable data types. Because there aren't that many different data types reported by New Relic products and integrations, this will mainly be a limit on custom events.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

Learn more about anomalies here and view your anomalies here in New Relic One. Using AI to find correlated failures Principal Product Manager Nate Heinrich shows us how anomalies and alerts can be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Smart alert muting Sr. Product Manager Brian Goleno shows us how to use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations, which is visible in Applied Intelligence.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Easily access your insert and query API keys by going to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data> API Keys Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "You can use this dictionary to guide your writing on docs.newrelic.com. We use this to help ensure consistency across our Docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the Docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta When using as a watermark or in the doc's title, use all caps: <div id=\"watermark\">BETA</div> Copy Don't include a callout within the document unless the beta requires additional explanation. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: <Callout variant=\"important\"> This feature currently is in private beta. To join the beta, contact your New Relic account rep. </Callout> Copy If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right-click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also mouse over. collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation Avoid referring to the document itself (the docs site page) as much as possible. If there's not a good alternative, you can use doc, document, or documentation (whatever sounds most natural; try reading it aloud). For example, This document explains how to... or For related docs, see... dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account The primary account in a New Relic account with sub-accounts. Refer to a master's subordinate accounts as sub-accounts, not children or slaves. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for watermarking docs for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account Don't use. See master account. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of Browser docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for Browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing (in Browser docs) or New Relic Browser (in non-Browser docs). Within Browser docs, use this term only for SEO or clarification, never to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures. However, avoid using generic “you” or “your” when permissions are involved, because we can't assume what permissions the user has. For example, we can't just say “you can add and remove users from your account settings” when that is actually an Owner or Admin level capability. When permissions are relevant, use a permissions callout.",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

The maximum amount of columns is 12. title: The title of the widget. linkedEntities: Dashboard Entities related to the widget. Currently it only supports dashboard entities. It is used by the facet linking feature. configuration: The typed configuration of the widget. It’s a conveniently typed GraphQL representation of the most common widgets: area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. rawConfiguration: The untyped configuration of the widget. It’s a free-form way (JSON scalar) of storing widget properties not covered by the typed configuration such as heatmap, histogram, bullet, funnel, etc. In this case configuration is null and rawConfiguration holds all the data required by the widget. Types of widgets The dashboards API supports typed and untyped widgets: Typed widgets Typed widgets are area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, and table. They can be built directly using NerdGraph, which provides assistance with the required fields. As an input: You only need to provide the configuration. visualization can be null as long as it can be inferred from the provided configuration. As an output, the API will provide the configuration you provided plus the raw representation in JSON at rawConfiguration. Therefore, rawConfiguration is always a superset of all widget configurations. Untyped widgets Untyped widgets are all other widgets, such as bullet, histogram, inventory, etc. For untyped widgets, we know and validate the shape of the JSON provided. For example, a heatmap has a specific configuration we know in advance, so we can validate it. As an input: configuration is not considered in this case. rawConfiguration must be provided. See the examples below. visualization cannot be null and it should be a fixed string like viz.heatmap or viz.bullet. As an output, the API answers exactly with what was provided in the input. Typed widget definitions Area Area supports multiple nrql queries. Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget. Input { widgets: { configuration: { area: { nrqlQueries: { accountId: 12345678, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } } } rawConfiguration: null } } Copy Output { \"visualization\": \"viz.area\" \"configuration\": { \"area\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] }, \"bar\": null, \"billboard\": null, \"line\": null, \"markdown\": null, \"pie\": null, \"table\": null } \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" } ] } } Copy Bar Widget data element Description accountId Integer Source account to fetch data from. query String The NRQL query that provides the data for the widget.

      "body": "In Grafana, you can configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source. Not only that, within Grafana you can query metrics stored in New Relic using the PromQL query language. Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic One supports a variety of visualizations to present your data in whatever format works best for your needs. A chart's refresh rate is calculated based on the query's timeframe. Chart types for events You can browse your data using several options in New Relic One, including: Data explorer Basic or advanced (NRQL) queries Advanced PromQL-style mode When you create a chart in the New Relic One query builder, you can select any of the chart types appropriate for that query. Depending on the data specified in your query, some chart types may be unavailable (grayed out). A small table shows the availability status of a chart type for Insights and New Relic One. Area chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. If you're using advanced (NRQL) mode you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use Area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid Area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Attribute sheet Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights An attribute sheet is a list of values for a single set of selected attributes. It is similar to the table chart type but is an option only when you are not using a FACET clause. The attribute sheet shows the single value from the query results. Use attribute street when you want to View a list of attributes for a set of single-value attributes. Avoid attribute street when you want to View data when you have used FACET function in your query. The table chart type is an option when your query uses FACET or when you have multiple values for each attribute. Bar chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use billboard when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use bullet when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid bullet when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. The bullet chart type is not supported in Insights; use the gauge chart type instead. Event [check icon] Basic mode [check icon] Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights * * * * The event chart type lists the data in a text format. Use event when you want to Create a text file that contains the attribute name and its value. The file can be shared and the content easily embedded into a report or spreadsheet, for example. Avoid event when you want to Present the data in a graphic, which can be helpful when monitoring the event on a dashboard. The billboard chart type is a good option for single-value data visualization. Funnel Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use funnels to evaluate a series of related events that are the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Gauge Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the gauge chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The gauge chart type displays a single value compared against a limit. The gauge defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, select in the Limit field and enter another number; the gauge will adjust accordingly. When the value returned by the query exceeds the limit value, the gauge shows the limit value in blue, and the overage in purple. Use gauge when you want to View a large and easy-to-read comparison a value compared against a limit that you set. Avoid gauge when you want to Create a query that uses COMPARE WITH, as gauge will not be listed as an option. Gauge is not supported in New Relic One; use the bullet chart type instead. Heat map Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode> ** * * **Insights** * * ** The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram Basic mode ** Advanced (NRQL) mode * * ** Insights * * * * * * A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. Tip If you are using Insights, copy the JSON using the Copy JSON button. If you are using New Relic One query builder, use the Share menu to select Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSOON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart chart type plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic mode in New Relic One, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When working with an NRQL query, either in Insights or advanced (NRQL) mode in New Relic One, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. List Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode< Insights The list chart type lists unique values for a given attribute. It is an option when the uniques( ) function is used in the select method. The list chart type shows the set of unique values for a given attribute. Use list when you want to Create a list of the value associated with each attribute. This list can be shared and easily added to reports and spreadsheets, for example. Avoid list when you want to When the data you want to view has multiple values for each attribute. The event chart type may be an option for New Relic One users. Pie chart Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart chart type maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic mode. If you're using Insights or advanced (NRQL) mode, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Table Basic mode< Advanced (NRQL) mode Insights A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry will take you to an existing dashboard that is filtered by that attribute. If you have multiple dashboards filtered by that attribute, Insights selects the first one created. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid table when you want to View your data in a graphical format. Chart types for metric data Metric chart are unique from other event-based charts. You can view aggregated metric data reported to New Relic from your agent. To add and customize metric charts on your Insights dashboard, use the Metric Explorer. The metric explorer is not yet supported in New Relic One. However, once you have added a metric chart to dashboard, you can use the query builder in advanced (NRQL) mode to edit the query. To use advanced (NRQL) mode in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click the query data icon. If the query builder opens in basic mode, click Advanced (NRQL) in the top right corner of the basic mode container. Use the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode to select the query associated with the metric chart on the Insights dashboard. When you open the query builder, you will see the last query mode you used, either basic mode or advanced (NRQL) mode. The My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode will display all of your New Relic queries, for both Insights and New Relic One, for both basic and advanced (NRQL) modes.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. The newer model offers a much simpler, more efficient way to manage users and what they have access to (learn more about the benefits of the new model). At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and our existing customers' users remained on our original user model. Now some of our original-model customers can use a migration wizard in the UI to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Requirements The easiest way to see if you have access to the user migration wizard is to check if it’s visible in the UI. Factors affecting access to the migration wizard: You must have the Owner role. The migration wizard is not available for some organizations that have a more complex account structure. If the migration wizard is not available and you wish to migrate your users, contact your New Relic account representative. Before beginning The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first understand our new user management concepts. A brief summary: Users reside within a container known as an “authentication domain,” which governs how those users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI vs. automatically with a SCIM-based identity provider), and how they log in (manually with email/password vs. using SAML SSO), and other settings. Typically organizations have just one or two domains: one with the default manual settings and one for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often in multiple groups. When you want to add new groups, or give groups access to more accounts, you must create an access grant. This assigns a group access to: 1) a specific role and 2) a specific account. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role (a role being a custom set of capabilities). The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first plan out how your user groups and access grants will be structured. Use the user migration wizard If you meet the requirements, you can use the wizard. To start using the migration wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation and then click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: if you have problems, see Tips. Once your users are migrated to the new model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs. full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs. Tips on using the migration wizard The migration wizard is meant to have all the context you need to complete the migration process but here are some tips for potential areas of confusion: Guided setup vs. automatic setup: Simple organizations with few users and few accounts, and who have little need for users to have separate roles or separate account access, may decide to choose the automatic setup. If you require some user access customization, or if your users use SAML SSO to sign in or are managed via an identity service provider (like Okta), use the guided setup. Once an account’s Owner does the initial step in the wizard of migrating admins, those admins are then able to access and complete the remainder of the migration wizard. The migration wizard gives you an option to download a full list of your existing original user model users (aka v1 users) before choosing to migrate users. We recommend downloading that file because it can serve as a useful reference and, in case it’s needed, as a backup file. To check on the status of your user migration, you can go to the User management UI to see which users are on the new model. After migration, some users may end up with access to logins for both an original model account and a new model account, both associated with a single email address. This is because our original user model allowed a user, with a single login, to access data from multiple organizations (a common scenario for contractors, for example). But the new user model gives more user control to organizations, and this means that these users now need a different login for each organization. If a user previously had access that spanned multiple organizations, they retain an original user record until migration is completed for all associated organizations. When a user has an email address associated with multiple logins, they'll be asked to verify their email. If your email address is associated with multiple logins, you can verify your email to see those accounts. In the example above, the “Original New Relic account” refers to that user record being on the older, original account/user model.",

The automatic instrumentation will work if the waitress.serve() API function is used directly, or if egg:waitress#main is specified as the server to use when starting up the web application using PasteDeploy. Admin script integration method You can use the recommended admin script integration method, as described in the general installation documentation. Using PasteDeploy If rather than manually integrating the call to startup the Waitress WSGI server in your application code, you are using PasteDeploy with a configuration similar to: [server:main] use = egg:waitress#main host = 127.0.0.1 port = 8080 Copy all you instead need to do to start up your WSGI application is wrap the running of the paster command: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini Copy",

      "body": "If you use PHPUnit to manage and run your unit tests, the New Relic PHP agent can automatically capture the test summary results and send them to New Relic as an event where you can query and visualize test data at a glance. This feature was released in version 6.7.0 of the PHP Agent and supports PHPUnit versions 3.7 to 8.x Enable PHPUnit test events To enable PHPUnit test events: Find or add the newrelic.phpunit_events.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini file and set it to true. Restart your web server (apache, PHP-FPM, Nginx, etc) for the setting change to take effect. Tip Exception messages are collected and sent with events. Also, if you use PHPUnit's --disallow-test-output option, which flags tests that print output as \"risky,\" the test event will include the offending output. View available attributes When enabled, the PHP Agent detects PHPUnit commands and populates New Relic with two event types that contain data for the test suite (named TestSuite) and individual tests (named Test). You can query the data with NRQL queries and build a dashboard of information important to you. To query your test events, use FROM TestSuite and FROM Test when specifying your SELECT statements: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM TestSuite Copy Example of a PHPUnit test dashboard created by querying TestSuite and Test events. Example queries A dashboard of test summary data allows you to quickly see a snapshot of overall test success as well as dig into failing suites to determine their cause. These examples illustrate the kinds of widgets you can create with both TestSuite and Test event types. Percent success What percent of suites or tests are passing? SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE successful IS true) FROM TestSuite Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE outcome = 'passed') FROM Test Copy What percent of suites and tests are passing? Test outcome What is the breakdown of test outcomes? SELECT count(*) FROM Test FACET outcome Copy What is the breakdown of test outcomes? Test failures What percent of the time does each test pass? SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE outcome = 'failed') FROM Test FACET name Copy What percent of the time does each test pass? Test suite failures What percent of the time does each suite pass, and is that consistent over time? SELECT histogram((passedCount / testCount)*100, 100, 10) FROM TestSuite FACET name Copy What percent of the time does each suite pass, and is that consistent over time? Duration How long does each test suite take to run, and is that consistent over time? SELECT histogram(duration*1000, 10, 20) FROM TestSuite FACET name Copy How long does each test suite take to run, and is that consistent over time? Linked facets Because a PHPUnit test suite is linked to individual tests via its run ID, you can use FACET widgets to filter results for a specific test run. For example, if you created a widget with the most recent failing test suites and linked it to the current dashboard, you could click on a test and the surrounding widgets would update with information for only that test suite run. FACET widget (top-left) linked to the current dashboard allows you to drill into failing test suites. In the above example, you can see that by clicking on run 5bb37ccee2a1dbc7, we learn that one of two tests, testFoo, failed. Here are the NRQL queries that made up this example: Recent unsuccessful suites: SELECT latest(timestamp), latest(name) FROM TestSuite WHERE successful IS false FACET runId Copy Last unsuccessful suite: SELECT host, name, duration * 1000 AS 'duration (ms)', assertionCount, testCount, passedCount, failedCount, incompleteCount, skippedCount, errorCount, riskyCount, warningCount FROM TestSuite WHERE successful IS false LIMIT 1 Copy Last unsuccessful test: SELECT host, name, testSuiteName, duration * 1000 AS 'duration (ms)', outcome, assertionCount, message FROM Test WHERE outcome != 'passed' LIMIT 1 Copy PHPUnit event attributes TestSuite and Test events contain the following attributes you can query against: TestSuite event attributes TestSuite events include the following attributes: Attribute Description duration The number of seconds it took for the test suite to run. assertionCount The total number of assertions the test suite made. errorCount The number of errors reported. warningCount The number of tests with warnings. Note that PHPUnit includes these in the passedCount as well. failedCount The number of failed tests. incompleteCount The number of incomplete tests. passedCount The number of passed tests. riskyCount The number of tests marked by PHPUnit as risky. skippedCount The number of tests that were skipped. testCount The number of tests that ran. runId A unique identifier that ties the test suite to the individual tests. For example, 861d12cea0d5b923. successful A boolean that is true if there were no failures or errors during the test suite run. name The name of the test suite. Test event attributes Test events include the following attributes: Attribute Description duration The number of seconds it took for the test to run. message Any message associated with the test outcome. For example: Failed asserting that false is true or This test depends on 'StackTest::testFailure' to pass.. assertionCount The number of assertions the test made. outcome The outcome of the test. Options include passed, failed, skipped, risky, warning, and incomplete. runId A unique identifier that ties the test to its test suite. For example: 861d12cea0d5b923. name The name of the test. testSuiteName The name of the parent test suite.

      "body": "New Features PHPUnit test events Support has been added for the popular unit test library PHPUnit (versions 3.7 to 5.5, inclusive). When enabled, the agent reports test results as custom Insights events. Test suite summary data are sent as TestSuite events, while individual test cases are sent as Test events. You can enable this feature in your newrelic.ini file with newrelic.phpunit_events.enabled = true. Depending on your events retention policy, enabling this setting may impact your New Relic billing statement. Read more about this feature on our documentation site. Support has been added for Slim Framework 2.x and 3.x. Upgrade Notices To avoid potential deadlocks, MySQL SELECT queries that use the FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE suffixes will no longer generate explain plans. Bug Fixes Automatic page load timing instrumentation was broken on PHP 5.4-7.0 in certain edge cases: most notably, when the <head> element was not in the first 40kB of the page content, or when the </body> element was not in the last few kilobytes of content.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For sub-accounts, you'd use the sub-account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a sub-account. Instead, to create sub-accounts, use the master account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored. Account object JSON request { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Sample Account\", \"application_type\": \"ruby\", \"users\": [ { \"email\": \"sample_user@sample.org\", \"password\": \"XXXXXXXX\", \"owner\": true, \"role\": \"admin\", \"first_name\": \"Sample\", \"last_name\": \"User\" } ], \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 10 }, { \"product_id\": 10, \"quantity\": 0 } ], \"allow_api_access\": true, \"phone_number\": \"555-555-5555\" } } Copy JSON response { \"id\": XXXXXX, \"name\": \"Sample Account\", \"status\": \"pending\", \"license_key\": \"caf8247360d8db295c142c72138fa8fb28df1403\", \"api_key\": \"86f818b6d81668b6c034661396b71c25bb323d8b8df1403\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"66617123f5\", \"allow_api_access\": true, \"high_security\": false, \"testing\": null, \"partner_external_identifier\": null, \"subscription\": { \"id\": XXXXXX, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-17\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 10, \"price\": 1990.0 }, { \"product_id\": 10, \"name\": \"Mobile Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 16, \"name\": \"Insights None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] }, \"primary admin\": { \"id\": XXXXXX, \"email\": \"sample_user@sample.org\", \"first_name\": \"Sample\", \"last_name\": \"User\", \"state\": \"active\" } } Copy Account object API examples Partnerships with more than 1000 accounts return a paginated response.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get or generate your Insights insert key and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_INSERT_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.test.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_INSERT_KEY Replace this with your Insights insert API key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",
