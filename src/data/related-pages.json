      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the PlatformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the PlatformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

      "body": "NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic user key. You can create one from the NerdGraph API Explorer or view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "Organizing your services, hosts, and applications in New Relic can be challenging, especially as resources come and go. One strategy to overcome this challenge is to apply tags, consistently, across your stack. In this guide, you: Provision a host on AWS Deploy a small Node.js app on that host Instrument the host and the application with New Relic agents Apply consistent tags across all your entities Tear down everything you make when you're done The next section introduces you to tools for performing tasks in this guide. Before you begin Throughout this guide, you use three open source projects to automatically set up, instrument, and tear down your infrastructure: Demo Deployer: The engine that drives the automation Demo Nodetron: A Node.js app that you run on your host. It presents a web page and an API, which you use to generate traffic. Demo New Relic Instrumentation: A project that instruments your host and application Each project is distinct, and encapsulates its own behavior. This maintains a separation of concerns and allows you to compose complex scenarios using a modular approach. Collaborate with us The Demo Deployer is currently in development. Because of our commitment to open source, we are working in the open early in the process and invite you to collaborate with us. Drop any thoughts and comments in the Build on New Relic support thread, and let us know what you think! The last thing you need before you get started is to install Docker if you don't have it already. Now that you have a high-level understanding of the tools you'll use, you can begin by pulling the Demo Deployer! Step 1 of 6 Pull the deployer locally Pull the deployer Docker image from our GitHub Container Registry: bash Copy $ docker pull ghcr.io/newrelic/deployer:latest Now, you have a local Docker image, named deployer, which you use throughout the rest of this guide. Step 2 of 6 Configure your credentials In this guide, you provision a host on AWS. The deployer uses a configuration file that contains your credentials for each service it communicates with so that it can invoke the necessary APIs. You can follow the User Config documentation in the deployer repository to set up each account and create your configuration file. In the end, you'll have a JSON file that contains credentials for AWS, New Relic, and GitHub: { \"credentials\": { \"aws\": { \"apiKey\": \"my_aws_api_key\", \"secretKey\": \"my_aws_secret_key\", \"secretKeyPath\": \"/path/to/my/secretkey.pem\", \"region\": \"my_aws_region\" }, \"newrelic\": { \"licenseKey\": \"my_new_relic_license_key\", \"accountId\": \"my_new_relic_account_id\" }, \"git\": { \"username\": \"my_git_access_token\" } } } Copy Name the credentials file creds.json, and store it—along with your [keypair filename].pem file—in a directory called $HOME/configs. Step 3 of 6 Run the application Now that everything is set up, you can run the deployer application in a Docker container: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby ghcr.io/newrelic/deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/hello/hello.aws.json With this command, you're running the deployer Docker container with the following options: -v mounts the $HOME/configs volume (where you stored your configuration files) at /mnt/deployer/configs/ in the container --entrypoint sets the default command for Docker to ruby Finally, you pass a list of arguments to the entrypoint, including: -c configs/creds.json: The user credentials configuration file -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/hello/hello.aws.json: The deployment configuration file Tip You can specify the log level for the deployer using -l. info is the default, but you can also use debug or error. This is a helpful option to use when something goes wrong. Once you run this command, the deployer will create and instrument some specific resources. This may take a few minutes. In the meantime, read on to learn more about what is actually happening during this process. Locating the user configuration files Notice, in the Docker command, that -c takes configs/creds.json. Also, you referenced your .pem file from configs/, as well. This is because you mounted $HOME/configs to /mnt/deployer/configs/ and /mnt/deployer/ is the working directory, according to the deployer's Dockerfile. So, you can access your user configuration files at configs/, which is a relative path from your working directory. Understanding the deployment configuration file The deployment configuration file, hello.aws.json, which drives the deployer, contains four sections: services global_tags resources instrumentations These sections describe the actions the deployer executes. The first section is services: { \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"app1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-App1\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"port\": 5001, \"destinations\": [\"host1\"], \"files\": [ { \"destination_filepath\": \"engine/data/index.json\", \"content\": <some content> } ] } ] } Copy services defines one service, app1, which lives on host1 at port 5001. It uses the Demo Nodetron you learned about earlier in this guide as its source. Important In this example, some HTML has been removed for clarity. To run the deployer, you need to use the real content in hello.json. The second section is global_tags: { \"global_tags\": { \"dxOwningTeam\": \"DemoX\", \"dxEnvironment\": \"development\", \"dxDepartment\": \"Area51\", \"dxProduct\": \"Hello\" } } Copy global_tags defines tags for the deployer to apply to all the resources in your stack. These tags are an important part of organizing your New Relic entities. The third section is resources: { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"host1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-Host1\", \"provider\": \"aws\", \"type\": \"ec2\", \"size\": \"t3.micro\" } ] } Copy resources defines one host, host1, which is a small EC2 instance on AWS. This host is referred to in the services section. The fourth, and final, section is instrumentations: { \"instrumentations\": { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_infra\", \"resource_ids\": [\"host1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"1.12.1\" } ], \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_node_agent\", \"service_ids\": [\"app1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/node/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"6.11.0\" } ] } } Copy instrumentations configures, as the name implies, New Relic instrumentations for the host1 infrastructure and the app1 Node.js application. These definitions use the Demo New Relic Instrumentation project you learned about earlier. Step 4 of 6 Generate some traffic When deployer has run successfully, you will see a message that describes the resources deployed and services installed during the process: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful! Deployed Resources: host1 (aws/ec2): ip: 52.90.86.109 services: [\"app1\"] instrumentation: nr_infra: newrelic v1.12.1 Installed Services: app1: url: http://52.90.86.109:5001 instrumentation: nr_node_agent: newrelic v6.11.0 Completed at 2020-08-20 15:11:14 +0000 Visit your application by navigating to the app1 url in your browser: From there, you can follow the instructions to send traffic to New Relic. Important Your app1 url will be different than the url shown in this guide. Step 5 of 6 Check your tags After you've generated some traffic to your Node.js application, use the New Relic search redirect to find the resources you deployed: Once you have found your resources, select the service you deployed, Hello-App1. Then, click on the 'i' icon next to the name, which opens the metadata and tags modal: Notice that all the tags in the global_tags section of the deployment configuration show up under Tags: If you open the metadata modal for the host, you'll also see the global_tags. Step 6 of 6 Tear down your resources Because you've provisioned resources in your cloud account, you need to decommission them. You can do this with the deployer. Add the teardown flag, -t, to the end of your command: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby ghcr.io/newrelic/deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/hello/hello.aws.json -t When the deployer has finished successfully, you'll see output that is similar to what you saw during deployment: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Teardown [✔] Parsing and validating Teardown configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Uninstalling On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Uninstalling Services and instrumentations success [✔] Terminating infrastructure success [INFO] Teardown successful! Next steps Congratulations! Throughout this guide, you used the Demo Deployer to provision and instrument a host and application in AWS and automatically configured those entities with a list of tags. Next, try creating your own deployment configuration and change the global tags! One cool thing you can do is pass in a configuration file URL to the deployer. Here's one that uses a gist on GitHub: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby ghcr.io/newrelic/deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markweitzel/d281fde8ca572ced6346dc25470790a5/raw/373166eb50929a0dd23ba5136abf2fa5caf3d369/MarksHelloDemoConfig.json",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method.

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic user key. You can create one from the NerdGraph API Explorer or view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "You can add tags to your data to help improve data organization and findability. Learn more about tagging at New Relic. This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } コピー The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } コピー Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } コピー Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } コピー Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } コピー If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ > -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"common\": { $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" $ } $ }, $ \"spans\": [ $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"ABC\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"duration.ms\": 12.53, $ \"name\": \"/home\" $ } $ }, $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"DEF\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", $ \"duration.ms\": 2.97, $ \"name\": \"/auth\", $ \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"metrics\": [ $ { $ \"name\": \"memory.heap\", $ \"type\": \"gauge\", $ \"value\": 2.3, $ \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, $ \"attributes\": { $ \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"customerId\": \"xyz\" $ } $ ]' Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ \"logs\": [ $ { $ \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, $ \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" $ } $ ] $ ]'",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks.

Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you.

Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic user key. You can create one from the NerdGraph API Explorer or view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Important Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 8 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 8 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Step 3 of 8 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 8 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 8 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: bash Copy $ cd ../.. Step 6 of 8 If this is your first time executing this code run the below command to install all the required modules: bash Copy $ npm install Step 7 of 8 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Important If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Important In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic user key. You can create one from the NerdGraph API Explorer or view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the PlatformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the PlatformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Important Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 8 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 8 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Step 3 of 8 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 8 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 8 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: bash Copy $ cd ../.. Step 6 of 8 If this is your first time executing this code run the below command to install all the required modules: bash Copy $ npm install Step 7 of 8 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Important If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Important In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components. Using the NerdGraphQuery.query method to query data before the application renders.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. ヒント To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. 注意 Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. 注意 Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest コピー Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest コピー View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME コピー When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts コピー If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update コピー Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY コピー To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY コピー Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods コピー Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME コピー Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID コピー Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% コピー Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME コピー Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE コピー Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help コピー To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion コピー helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion コピー Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE コピー Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... コピー OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... コピー Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer ヒント If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the chart builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your New Relic APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Tip Proactive Detection is automatically enabled and available at no additional cost. All that's required is data from your APM-monitored applications flowing into New Relic. To signup and take advantage of this and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization. Create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Query your data more easily At the top of all UI pages, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the NRQL mode query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization. Create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Query your data more easily At the top of all UI pages, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the NRQL mode query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorer's Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard pricing tier includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic user key. You can create one from the NerdGraph API Explorer or view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official New Relic Kubernetes operator. More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes. Before you begin This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with kind. To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to: Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. Install New Relic for your application. Install kubectl and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator. Install kustomize. Step 1 of 3 Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster First, install cert-manager, which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes. bash Copy $ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml Next, install the Kubernetes operator. bash Copy $ kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f - To confirm the installation was successful, run a few kubectl commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator. Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system, has been applied: bash Copy $ kubectl get namespaces The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system: bash Copy NAME STATUS AGE cert-manager Active 4m35s default Active 20m kube-node-lease Active 20m kube-public Active 20m kube-system Active 20m newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Active 3m48s Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running: Note: Don't forget to include the --namespace (shorthand -n) option when running kubectl get pods to ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace. bash Copy $ kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system You should see output similar to the following: bash Copy NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j 2/2 Running 0 157m If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster. Step 2 of 3 Creating your first alert policy To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic. A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file new_relic_alert_policy.yaml. Note: For help locating your user key, check out New Relic's user key documentation. apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic user key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' Copy Now run the kubectl apply command to create your alert policy. bash Copy $ kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml You'll see output that reads similar to the following: bash Copy alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for \"Alert Policy Created With k8s.\" You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file. Step 3 of 3 Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line. In your new_relic_alert_policy.yaml file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period. Note: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, add notification channels to your alert policy, with this code. # The policy from the previous steps apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic user key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy conditions: - spec: type: 'NRQL' name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s' nrql: query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'\" evaluationOffset: 3 enabled: true terms: - threshold: '5' threshold_occurrences: 'ALL' threshold_duration: 180 priority: 'CRITICAL' operator: 'ABOVE' violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR' valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE' Copy With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy. bash Copy $ kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success. To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy. For example, maybe you want to send an email out to your team when your alert condition is triggered. Try it out now We have a Kubernetes test cluster ready for you in 2 minutes. By following this on-line tutorial, you will learn how to: Deploy the New Relic agent in a Kubernetes environment Use the New Relic Kubernetes operator Some tips to use the on-line tutorial window: Accept the cookies, so you can see the menu bar. Click anywhere in the tutorial window to start. It will take about 2 minutes for your environment to be ready. Press CTRL-l or type clear to clear the terminal window Click on the finish flag icon in the bottom menu to hide or show the instructions Good luck! Important Some browsers automatically disable the use of iframes. If the module isn't loading please check your browser settings. Your browser does not support iframes. What’s next? Nice work — now you can manage your New Relic alert policies and NRQL alert conditions with code that integrates seamlessly within your Kubernetes workflow. This provides the ability to configure and manage your alerts with a domain-specific pattern, providing consistency and maintainability. You also gain the benefits of code reviews for any potential changes moving forward. As you and your team move forward, you might need to adjust some of the configuration values to better fit your needs. The New Relic Kubernetes Operator is just one of several tools in the New Relic Developer Toolkit aimed at facilitating observability as code.",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Access and requirements You'll need a New Relic Insert API key. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting If you receive an NrIntegrationError, see Troubleshoot a NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "When you create a condition, you set thresholds that determine what will open a violation. This document explains what thresholds are and how to set them. What is a threshold? For a condition, thresholds are the settings that determine what opens a violation. Depending on a policy's incident preference, a violation may result in: The creation of an incident. Notifications being sent. Examples of thresholds: An application’s average web response time is greater than 5 seconds for 15 minutes. An application’s error rate per minute hits 10% or higher at least once in an hour. An application’s AJAX response time deviates a certain amount from its expected baseline behavior. Besides a mandatory critical threshold level, you can also set thresholds for a less serious warning level, which doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. View and set thresholds Thresholds are set during the process of creating a condition: Goal Instructions Set thresholds for a new condition Set thresholds as part of the process of creating a condition. View and update thresholds for existing conditions To view a condition’s thresholds: find that condition in the UI. To update thresholds, select a condition’s thresholds and make changes. To learn more about specific alert condition types (like baseline and NRQL), see Types of conditions. Details about other functionality and rules: Use the Alerts API You can list and edit conditions with the Alerts API. Set optional warning level You can set thresholds for two levels: critical (required) and warning (optional). Threshold level Details Critical (red) Required. When a violation occurs, it will send notifications depending on incident preference settings. Warning (yellow) Optional. Doesn't open incidents or generate notifications, but will roll up into incidents that are already open. Use a warning threshold if you want to monitor when a system behavior is concerning or noteworthy but not important enough to require a notification. Loss of signal (NRQL only) A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by New Relic. This could be the result of an entity or service going offline, an issue with an agent or collector, or networking problems in a data center or the internet. You can use loss of signal detection to create a new violation and notification if a signal stops and you expect a service to be stable. You may also want to use this to determine when an ephemeral service stops and set the action to close any open violations that exist for this condition. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this announcement. Set time intervals Different condition types have different minimum time intervals. For example, some condition types have a minimum time interval of 5 minutes (for example, APM metric alert conditions), and others have a minimum time interval of 1 minute (for example, NRQL alert conditions). Set URL for runbook instructions For how to set this via the UI, see Runbook instructions.",

Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your New Relic APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Tip Proactive Detection is automatically enabled and available at no additional cost. All that's required is data from your APM-monitored applications flowing into New Relic. To signup and take advantage of this and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity. Example: APM. entity.domainId string The id used to uniquely identify the entity within the domain. entity.guid string The guid used to uniquely identify the entity across all products. entity.name string The name of the entity. Example: Laura’s coffee service entity.link string A link to view the entity. Example: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/applications/987654321” Copy severity enum A description of how unusual of a change occurred, including NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL. version string Version used to describe the data being provided. Example: v1 JSON schema example Applied Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx).

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. In New Relic Insights, the Data explorer UI page lets you explore the data available to you in Insights. There are two tabs available: Events Metrics This document will explain details about using the Metrics tab. For information on the Events tab, see Events data explorer. Features Use the Insights Data explorer for metrics to: Search and chart metric timeslice data reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile (including custom metrics). Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to monitor the data most interesting to you or another team in a centralized place, alongside any NRQL-based event charts. Important You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which gives you more power and flexibility when querying this data. Here are some examples of how to get the most out of the metric explorer: Add to an Insights dashboard As you search for agent metrics and create charts in the metric explorer, add them to Insights dashboards to collect, organize, share, and see them alongside other Insights charts. This option is a standard page function available for most metric charts in the New Relic UI. Explore API If you use the New Relic REST API, use the metric explorer to: Browse through your metric data. Search and find the exact metric and metric values you need. Review or sample the charted data. Load the REST API Explorer preset to the selected metric and time range by selecting View in API Explorer. Metric charts The metric explorer enables you to search and create customizable charts for any of your New Relic metric data. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart. Customize your metric chart in the metric explorer for more precise views of your data. Search metrics Find any metric quickly by selecting the relevant entities first, then search or browse the metric namespaces for the metric. Search results are ordered by relevance. The metric explorer also suggests entities and metrics that are commonly used or that have a lot of data you may want to browse and drill into. For example, the metric explorer displays the root namespaces for metrics (Apdex, Datastore, EndUser, External, etc.) to make it easier for users to traverse and find their metrics. You can use some basic regex tokens in your search string. For example: Use ^ to start matching with the string that follows it. Use *as a wildcard. Some New Relic functions, like creating metric alerts, require the exact metric name. For information on how to get a metric's exact name, see Get exact metric name. Share charts Metric explorer creates a permalink URL that displays the charts and data for the selected time range for the current page. Permalinks can be used to share data and charts with colleagues, New Relic support staff, or anyone who has access to your New Relic account. Workflow To search and chart your New Relic agent metrics: From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity or application your metrics report under. Browse the top metrics or search for a specific metric name. View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To load the API Explorer (preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Examples Add custom metric charts to a dashboard Use case: The New Relic agent is not automatically capturing response time metric data for some part of your app's code, but you want to see and monitor its performance regularly. Instrument your code to record and send the custom metric to New Relic. For example, use an agent API call and a custom metric name like Custom/MyMetric/My_label. Once your code is running and sending data to New Relic, go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. From the metric explorer page, select the entity that your agent is reporting metrics under. Search for the custom metric name. Tip Use the metric explorer's Suggested Search (automatically filled with Custom) to easily find your custom metrics. Select the metric name to chart the metric data. Configure the chart, using available options for time window, chart values (Y-axis), facet by host (if available), etc. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Add metric chart for CPU usage faceted by host Use case: You want to see how CPU usage is impacting your different hosts for a given application. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the app. Search for CPU. From the search results, select CPU/System/Utilization to have the metric explorer automatically create a chart showing the percentage of CPU utilization on the app. Optional: To see a larger scope of metrics, add wildcards to the namespaces in front of CPU. To show the CPU percentage broken out by host on the new chart, select View by host. To organize this chart alongside similar charts or other NRQL charts, select Add to an Insights dashboard. Search metrics to get relevant REST API call Use case: You want to feed metrics into an external system to track trends in performance over time outside of New Relic Insights or other New Relic products. From insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics, select the entity (application or host). Search for and select a metric that you'd like to chart. To review the data preset to the selected metric and time range: From the new chart, select View in API Explorer. Get exact metric name to alert on it Use case: You want to find the exact metric name in order to alert on it with New Relic Alerts. To use the metric explorer to get the exact name for a metric: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data explorer > Metrics. Search for and select a metric. Under the metric chart, select View in API Explorer. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name in the names [ ] field. From the selected policy's conditions page under Define thresholds, select Custom > Enter metric name from the When target application dropdown and paste the metric name in the Metric name field. For more about finding metric names, including using the API to do so, see Locate exact metric names. Query metric timeslice data with NRQL You can also query metric timeslice using NRQL, which is a more powerful, flexible way to query than using Insights' metric explorer.",

Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity.

      "body": "Building your own visualizations for New Relic dashboards enables you and your organization to query data from any source and display it on your dashboard. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the CLI to generate a visualization file structure, run it locally where you can quickly test and iterate, and then deploy it for use in a dashboard. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have a New Relic account. To complete this guide, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. Create a new visualization In this first set of steps you will use the CLI to quickly generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 3 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Start with a new Nerdpack. If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like my-awesome-nerdpack). If you need to create one, run nr1 create and select the nerdpack option. bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack Tip Note: If you only want to build a visualization in your Nerdpack, you can remove the nerdlets/ and launchers/ folders from the nerdpack Step 3 of 3 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project and run the nr1 create command, selecting the visualization option. bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the visualizations directory in the root of your Nerdpack project. The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query. The nr1.json file provides metadata. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are: boolean string number json enum: a developer-defined list of string options. nrql: a single NRQL query string. namespace: a group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. collection: a repeatable group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. The nrqlQueries entry is an example of a collection type. The index.js file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the timeRange value from PlatformStateContext. The timeRange can be passed directly to the NrqlQuery component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's pollInterval prop to NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval. <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {({timeRange}) => ( <NrqlQuery timeRange={timeRange} pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL} > ... Copy Render the visualization in local development Now run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations. There you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 7 Start the local Node server for your Nerdpack. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Important To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local Node server. Changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local Node server and start it back up. Step 2 of 7 In a browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. This url is also shown in the terminal when the Node server starts. The nerdpacks=local query string will direct the UI to load your new visualization artifact from the local Node server. Advanced nerdpack configuration See the advanced nerdpack configuration section for detailed information about how your local Node server is proxied to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed. Step 3 of 7 Open the Apps page, and navigate to Custom Visualizations, which you will find favorited by default. Step 4 of 7 In the Custom Visualizations listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the Node server and refresh the browser. When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local Node server is rendered with prop-configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps. Step 5 of 7 You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The prop inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the nr1.json file in the visualization folder (for example ./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered. Step 6 of 7 Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for fillOpacity on the Radar component in index.js. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update. fillOpacity={1.0} visualizations/your-visualization/index.js Copy Step 7 of 7 To add more props, you must update the configuration field in the nr1.json file for your visualization and restart the local Node server. The props you define in the configuration field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a prop-editing UI for users interacting with your visualization. See above for more information about the configuration field. Deploy and use your visualization When your visualization is ready to be added to a dashboard, just follow these steps. Step 1 of 2 Open and follow the guide to publish and deploy the Nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it. Step 2 of 2 Then you can add your visualization to a dashboard.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advance configurations Extend webpack configuration You can use our .extended-webpackrc.js file to extend the webpack 4 configuration. This allows you to add your own aliases, scripts, and configurations when locally serving or deploying your app. Proxy browser setup Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic One. But understanding how this works can help you if you encounter issues (for example, with a proxy or browser setup). When developing, your code is served from your local laptop by using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and will use a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. In order to load third-party code into the platform, (both in development and production), New Relic One uses an <IFRAME>, as well as a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net) to perform the load, relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. For this reason, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where UserId is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform (you can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it). Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where NerdpackUuid is the UUID assigned to your package, and NerdpackGid is zero, or a positive integer (you can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it). Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Important Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 8 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 8 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Step 3 of 8 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 8 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 8 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: bash Copy $ cd ../.. Step 6 of 8 If this is your first time executing this code run the below command to install all the required modules: bash Copy $ npm install Step 7 of 8 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Important If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Important In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\" } ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Fetch a single secret query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters. Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as writing, deleting, and fetching data, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog.

Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021. We encourage you to start exploring the capabilities of the Dashboards API in NerdGraph now! You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key. Every user who wants to query with the NerdGraph API will need their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about API keys. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you. Get started with New Relic One New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more! one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One. Query anything With New Relic One, you get: Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL. Visualize more data Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. More charts or widgets across dashboards: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One!",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

Tip To use New Relic One and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like my-awesome-nerdpack). If you need to create one, run nr1 create and select the nerdpack option. bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack Tip Note: If you only want to build a visualization in your Nerdpack, you can remove the nerdlets/ and launchers/ folders from the nerdpack Step 3 of 3 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project and run the nr1 create command, selecting the visualization option. bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the visualizations directory in the root of your Nerdpack project. The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query. The nr1.json file provides metadata. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are: boolean string number json enum: a developer-defined list of string options. nrql: a single NRQL query string. namespace: a group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. collection: a repeatable group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. The nrqlQueries entry is an example of a collection type. The index.js file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the timeRange value from PlatformStateContext. The timeRange can be passed directly to the NrqlQuery component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's pollInterval prop to NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval. <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {({timeRange}) => ( <NrqlQuery timeRange={timeRange} pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL} > ... Copy Render the visualization in local development Now run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations. There you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 7 Start the local Node server for your Nerdpack. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Important To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local Node server. Changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local Node server and start it back up. Step 2 of 7 In a browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. This url is also shown in the terminal when the Node server starts. The nerdpacks=local query string will direct the UI to load your new visualization artifact from the local Node server. Advanced nerdpack configuration See the advanced nerdpack configuration section for detailed information about how your local Node server is proxied to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed. Step 3 of 7 Open the Apps page, and navigate to Custom Visualizations, which you will find favorited by default. Step 4 of 7 In the Custom Visualizations listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the Node server and refresh the browser. When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local Node server is rendered with prop-configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps. Step 5 of 7 You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The prop inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the nr1.json file in the visualization folder (for example ./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered. Step 6 of 7 Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for fillOpacity on the Radar component in index.js. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update. fillOpacity={1.0} visualizations/your-visualization/index.js Copy Step 7 of 7 To add more props, you must update the configuration field in the nr1.json file for your visualization and restart the local Node server. The props you define in the configuration field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a prop-editing UI for users interacting with your visualization. See above for more information about the configuration field. Deploy and use your visualization When your visualization is ready to be added to a dashboard, just follow these steps. Step 1 of 2 Open and follow the guide to publish and deploy the Nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it. Step 2 of 2 Then you can add your visualization to a dashboard.
