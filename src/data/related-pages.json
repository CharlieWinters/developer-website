      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline 2. Take advantage of integrations and existing tools It’s always worth taking a little extra time to look for time-saving integrations and tools that can help to achieve your automation goals. For example, you can use IBM’s open-sourced New Relic CLI (command line interface) tool to automate a variety of tasks, such as managing New Relic Synthetics monitors; creating, editing, and deleting New Relic Alerts policies and conditions; and managing user accounts. Use IBM's New Relic CLI tool to manage your Synthetics monitors, alert policies, and user accounts. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). The examples below use license keys (ingest keys), but personal API keys (user keys) are queried in similar ways. We recommend you experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete personal API keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name accountId notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "body": "In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and alert conditions violations, and replacing these pages with a new synthetic monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. For more information, check the EoL Announcements page. If you want to receive alert notifications when a synthetic monitor fails, you can configure the alert notification after you have created one. You can configure your monitor's alert condition via the Alerts UI. To identify which monitors do not have conditions assigned to them, review their color-coded health status. Add a synthetic monitor to alert policies A monitor can be included in multiple alert policies and conditions. You can view the alert policies and conditions for the selected monitor from the Alerts UI. To add an existing monitor to an alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Open the policy, then click Add a condition. Click Synthetics and then select the monitor. Fill out the remaining settings and click Create condition. Adding a new alert condition to a Synthetics monitor can take up to 30 minutes. Linking and registration need to take place before you can open an alert for a monitor violation. Existing monitor: Remove from alert policy To remove an existing monitor's alert condition from an existing alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate and select an alert policy where the monitor has an alert condition that has already been added. Select the trash can (delete) icon on the monitor's alert condition. Receive alert notifications on a three-strike basis Synthetic alert monitors operate on a three-strike basis, registering a failure only after three monitor attempts from a single location return an error. Your alert policy configuration and notification channel settings will determine when you receive notifications for specific monitors and locations. If you monitor a non-public app and add your selected public minion IPs to your allow list, you may very infrequently receive a false downtime alert. When a synthetic monitoring data center goes down, New Relic may decide to temporarily use an alternate host, which results in the temporary server's IP being blocked by your app. Mute (disable) monitor's alert notifications To temporarily disable notifications for a monitor, mute it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Monitors > (select a monitor). Click General under the Settings menu in the left menu sidebar. Click the Notifications button to Off. Muting a monitor's alert notifications will not mute multi-location alerts or NRQL alerts.

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from New Relic APM.

This means that we are not querying the at-rest data in NRDB at all when processing NRQL Condition alerts. While we use NRQL as a consistent language across the product, there are differences between how NRQL is executed against streaming analytics and how it is executed against the NRDB data store. Below are some key concepts around Streaming Alerts that will help you to better understand how they work with NRQL alert conditions. You can find additional information in our how-to resource, Create NRQL alert conditions. Streaming Alerts terms and concepts signal The signal is the stream of telemetry data that you have identified to watch and alert on. We use NRQL queries as the language to define the signal. signal filter After New Relic receives your data, it gets routed to the streaming alerts platform. The WHERE clause in the NRQL query serves as a filter that defines the signal that streams through the alerts platform. When we discuss gaps in a signal, or loss of signal, the data stream that results from this filter is the signal that we are discussing. aggregation window The streaming alerts platform works by moving time-bound windows of data through a pipeline. Data points are accumulated into a specific aggregation window based on the timestamp on the data point. aggregation function The NRQL query contains a function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() that specifies how the data points accumulated into an aggregation window should be processed, or calculated, to create a single data point. That aggregated data point is then passed to the alert evaluation process. streaming algorithm The streaming algorithm determines when the data in the aggregation window is processed submitted to Alert Evaluation. At this point, the streaming algorithm uses the server clock time to determine when to trigger an aggregation window to be processed. alert evaluation Alert evaluation assess a set of aggregation windows, based on the condition settings, to determine if an alert condition is violating, or recovering. Based on the threshold duration you set (for example, 5 minutes), it determines how many aggregation windows are contained within that duration. From there, it evaluates the aggregated data points within each time window. Any windows without data points are treated as a gap.

You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded alert status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter by tag or entity name There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities: Filter entities by tags: Use Filter with tags at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with production, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see Tagging. Filter by entity name: Use Search services by name at the top of the page. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Loss of signal Use the signal loss settings to: Set the signal loss time limit Close all current open violations Open new violations To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise and descriptive condition name. Choose how long data is collected before it's aggregated. Adjust the evaluation offset. Select whether or not to fill gaps with data and what values to use. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Sometimes a signal will have an aggregation window that does not contain data. This creates a gap in the data that is evaluated. This feature allows you to fill gaps in data with either the last known or a custom value that you choose. It is common to use a zero as the custom value. The default behavior is to leave gaps empty, which will restart the evaluation duration timer. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by New Relic. Sometimes, there's no data being sent and sometimes data is being lost. You can use loss of signal to customize whether and when you'll be notified after your last known signal. To create a NRQL alert that uses loss of signal: When creating a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Create a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the time in minutes or seconds after which the signal will be considered lost. When the signal is lost, check the boxes to Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. Make sure you name your condition and then save it. You can use a signal loss to close all of your currently open violations, open a lost signal violation, or do both. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Nested Aggregation NRQL Alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data and open up new possibilities to alert on. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query will produce a single result thus giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. Registering the inner query alone would be equivalent. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window Assuming the alert is registered with an aggregation window of 1 minute, this inner query would produce 2 smaller windows of width 30 seconds which could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems. For details, see Description.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/).

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "info": "To set up deployment notifications for apps monitored by New Relic APM, use webhooks, APM agent-specific options, or New Relic's REST API.",
      "body": "Deployments of applications can be risky events. New Relic allows you to correlate those events to the performance of your applications, using deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Several options are available to manage your deployment data. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Notify your team of deployments Owners and Admins After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. Using a Personal API key with the REST API To use a Personal API key in any of the examples below, replace 'X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY' with 'Api-Key','YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY'. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'X-Api-Key'='YOUR_API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your Admin User's API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ADMIN_USERS_KEY\" \\ -i Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.

View entities To use the entity explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Entity explorer. Your monitored entities are on the left. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded alert status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter by tag or entity name There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities: Filter entities by tags: Use Filter with tags at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with production, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see Tagging. Filter by entity name: Use Search services by name at the top of the page. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Our approach is to provide you with an aggregate view and opportunities to dig into more granular data around unique pageviews for troubleshooting performance issues. User Centric Perceived Performance Web performance teams can use more modern metrics than just page load time to benchmark and improve end-user experience for their dynamic pages. Browser helps developers understand how code impacts customers, answering key questions on page performance. Monitor how long users wait for content to display (paint metrics), how long until users can interact with our page (interactivity metrics), and how long until marquee content renders (largest contentful paint). (see blogpost for more) Single Page App Route Changes View Single Page Application route change performance, regardless of what JavaScript framework you use. Powerful low-level instrumentation can even capture interactions beyond the route change that can be customized via API, allowing monitoring tailored to the architecture of your application, such as for custom frameworks. Session Traces Session Traces provide one of the most valuable assets an engineer requires - context. Beyond identifying long load times, and specific errors, Browser Session Traces provide the story that occurred both before and after an error or performance issue. Pivot from AJAX requests and JavaScript errors into a Session Trace and conversely pivot from a Session Trace out to a specific JavaScript error or Network error. Browser Traces Traces are snapshots of one user’s experience, surfaced as an outlier due to a longer than average load time. It provides details around when it took place, a segmented breakdown of where load time was spent, browser type, and the user’s geographic location. This report is excellent when dissecting areas of your application which are performing poorly for specific users. Page Load Time - Segmentation Chart Page load times capture metrics from the moment a user begins a transaction in the browser until the page completes loading. The reports show average page load time broken down into color-coded segments for: Request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Page Load Time - Histogram and Percentiles Histograms and percentiles of browser page load times provide a holistic view of the speed of page loads, one that is not focused on averages alone. Histograms and percentiles surface every page load that occurred during a specified time window, providing the ability to drill into outliers that might have been overlooked otherwise. Geographic Reporting Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region. Identify if more CDN’s are required, or if high value customers in specific parts of the world are having a negative experience with your site’s performance. Page-Level AJAX Calls For a specific page, see all the AJAX calls being made as well as the response time, throughput (rpm), total number of calls, error status codes, and average data transfer made for each one. Page View Throughput Throughput is measured in requests per per minute. Throughput metrics help you understand which pages are being called most frequently. Connect Browser with Backend Performance From the Page views report, you can select single page URL and see all of the associated backend APM transactions (if you have the APM Agent installed in your application). Quickly view the total call time, average response time, and call count for any individual backend transaction. You can also dive deeper into a particular transaction and see diagnostics within our APM reports. Browser Performance New Relic's Browser dashboards provide information about your end users' experience based on browser type and version, so you can understand where to focus your time testing and optimizing for performance. Browser Throughput Provides a snapshot of the average number of pageviews received per minute broken down by browser type. Browser Load Time - Segmentation Chart For each type of browser, a segmented view of time spent on request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Browser Version Chart Helps you understand which versions of each browser type your customers come from based on throughput. AJAX If your applications use AJAX to update parts of a webpage after the initial page load, our AJAX dashboards will provide you with the level of visibility you need to understand how those requests are performing and ultimately affecting your users’ experience. AJAX Dashboard The main AJAX dashboard surfaces your site’s most resource intensive AJAX requests, filterable by time consumption, response time, throughput, callback time, and data transfer. From here you can drill into a particular call for detailed analysis. Calls by Page View Shows which page views are calling a particular server side controller, with page level detail around throughput, response time, total number of calls, and data transfer. Request Status Codes The status codes reporting indicates the return behavior from an AJAX call. A large number of non-200 status codes may indicate a problem with your AJAX endpoints. Data Transfer Per Request This shows data transfer which is requested and sent. Use this to look for correlations between high callback times and data transfer rates. JavaScript Errors The JavaScript error dashboards help you identify production JavaScript errors impacting your users' experiences and begin pinpointing how to resolve them. JavaScript Error Summary This summary view gives you a high level understanding of the types of JavaScript errors happening, the frequency at which they occur, and the percentage of users affected by the errors. Errors by Browser For each type of error, this chart shows you which browsers are being impacted by the error and the relative contribution it is making to your total error volume. Percentage of Page Views with Errors For each type of error, this chart shows you the percentage of page views affected by it. This allows you to quickly assess the reach and impact a particular error has on your end users. Error Instance Details Error Instance details grabs a snapshot of a single error and captures the stack trace details available from the browser, focusing on the actionable components, down to the line of code. These are metrics are combined with unique browser combinations down to the version level, and unique url. JavaScript diagnostics doesn't get more granular than this. Source Map Support Troubleshoot minified production JavaScript code, with source map support giving you full visibility to where in your code the front-end error is. Intuitive drag-and-drop lets you locate issues in a click, while API integrations work seamlessly with your build pipeline. Best-in-class Customer Experience Monitoring Crash analysis in New Relic Mobile lets you analyze the most impactful crashes and fix them faster. Source map support in New Relic Browser gives you more actionable visibility into front-end JS errors by showing you exactly where in the original source the error occurred, even if your code is minified. Global Features The following features are used throughout New Relic’s product suite to help make our products easier to use and fit seamlessly into your existing workflows. Quickly View App Health New Relic uses color coded status indicators throughout to help you quickly spot performance issues. Custom dashboards Keep an eye on your most critical performance metrics quickly by adding them to a custom dashboard. Integrate with your ticketing system File tickets related to performance problems directly into your ticketing system. Learn which ticketing systems we support. Alerting Check out our new Alerts Features for Browser that report on JS error %, response time, throughput and much more! Filterable Geography Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region, down to the city level. Identify how a CDN or ASN/ Internet Service Provider is performing in different regions. Security New Relic is committed to helping customers make their applications fast and secure. We take protecting our customers' data seriously, here's an overview of how we do it. U.S. and EU Data Regions Our global data-hosting structure consists of two regions: European Union and United States. You can select your preferred data region during the account setup process, regardless of your physical location. (Note: We do not support migration or aggregation of data across regions.) SOC2 Audited New Relic has successfully completed a SOC 2 audit of processes and controls relevant to security and availability. This audit reviews our security process and controls and provides both ourselves, and more importantly our customers an independent, third-party assurance that we are taking the appropriate steps to protect our systems and our customer’s data. Secure Data Center The infrastructure that runs the New Relic service and stores our customer’s data resides in a Tier III, SSAE-16 certified data center. Customer data is backed up on a regular basis. Continuous Monitoring New Relic employs both internal and third-party services to perform continuous security scanning on both our network and applications to ensure that our applications and servers remain secure. Secure by Default We strongly believe in the concept of “secure by default”. Customers have to explicitly enable settings within New Relic to authorize the sending of sensitive data. We want to make sure that you are not accidentally exposing anything that you don’t want to. Compliance Friendly New Relic can be configured to operate securely in regulated environments such as PCI, HIPAA, or SOX. In addition we are Swiss and EU Privacy Shield certified.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Frequently Asked Questions What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? What is NRQL? Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? What database does New Relic use? What Events are collected in New Relic? Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Can I add external data to New Relic? Can I extract data from New Relic? How much does New Relic cost? What is the data retention period for events I can query? What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? New Relic provides a real-time analytics platform that collects metrics, events, logs, and traces directly from your live production software, infrastructure, and services, transforming them into actionable insights about your entire stack, your business, and your customers' experiences. What is NRQL? NRQL, New Relic Query Language, is a SQL-like query language used to query the New Relic Database. Read more on how to get started using NRQL. Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? SQL knowledge will help in getting started with using New Relic like a pro, but it is not a required skill. New Relic comes equipped with built-in tutorials to get you up to speed quickly with its capabilities, pre-built example queries to experiment with, a point-and-click Chart Builder for querying your data, as well as an autocomplete feature to help guide the way when writing your own queries. What database does New Relic use? New Relic is powered by New Relic Database, a highly-distributed cloud-hosted time series database with an innovative architecture that does not require indexing. The database runs on a super-cluster built to support our thousands of customers - enabling you to query your big data in milliseconds. Learn more about New Relic Database. What Events are collected in New Relic? Out of the box, New Relic collects data on three event types from your web and mobile applications. For web applications, New Relic automatically collects PageViews events, which are instrumented by New Relic's Browser agent and Transaction events, which are instrumented by New Relic APM agents (.NET, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.js). For native mobile applications, New Relic automatically collects MobileSession events directly from your native mobile applications using the New Relic Mobile APM SDKs (iOS and Android). By default, New Relic Synthetics populates a set of default attributes. Query SyntheticCheck to return metrics from one run of a particular monitor, while SyntheticRequest attributes return results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Yes, New Relic has designed adding custom attributes to be a simple process. It typically requires no more than one additional line of code to your app per attribute. Decorating your PageView and Transaction events with custom attributes is a powerful way to collect events from your software that are not collected out of the box. MobileSession Events do not currently support adding custom attributes. Learn more about how to add custom attributes and what kind of data you can add. Can I add external data to New Relic? Yes, New Relic is an open platform, allowing you to send metric, event, log, and trace data from 3rd party instrumentation sources. For example, use custom events to store data in New Relic that is not available during a page view, server transaction or mobile session event. Learn more about how New Relic supports open instrumentation to ingest metrics data from Prometheus, tracing data instrumented with Zipkin, or logs data from Fluentd. Can I extract data from New Relic? Exporting data from New Relic is available via New Relic's API or via JSON code provided with each chart, graph and dashboard. Find out more about exporting New Relic data.  How much does New Relic cost? New Relic's subscription pricing is based on the number of metrics, events, logs, and traces stored in New Relic Database. Customers should reach out to an account executive to determine pricing. What is the data retention period for events I can query? Data retention varies based on the type of data stored (metrics, events, logs, and traces), and is generally up to you. New Relic has customizable data retention settings, so in some cases you can keep data in New Relic for as long as you want. Prices are determined by the amount of data that you store, so you will want to choose a retention period (where applicable) that meets your business and budgetary needs. Free access to New Relic.

Distributed tracing Distributed tracing plays a very important role in the troubleshooting experience since it lets you dig into the communication pipe between the AWS Lambda function and any other artifact that function talks to during its execution. Distributed tracing also gives you valuable information regarding what each transaction is about, the time it takes to complete, and if there were errors. Inventoried Tags and Metadata We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Facet Builder New Relic’s Facet Builder for AWS Lambda instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom insights—without having to write queries. Metrics, events, and other measurement High cardinality invocation data View throughput, detailed categorized AWS Lambda performance metrics like duration, cold starts, error rate and more at any transaction percentile. Filter and facet by tags and function metadata to rapidly find the answer you’re looking for. AWS CloudWatch Metrics We capture metrics harvested from AWS CloudWatch for over 30 connected AWS services including AWS Lambda, allowing you to understand the performance of event-driven architectures that include queues and data streams. Key event AWS Lambda metrics like iterator age, dead letter errors / dead letter queue depth, and throttles can be visualized along performance data from instrumentation in your functions. Custom attributes and custom events Capture and send custom attributes or events and tag their function invocations with attributes, so you can connect your performance data to specific business KPIs, or understand the performance of specific functionality within your function. Errors and alerts Rich error analysis View all the errors that occurred in your function code and analyze all the details and error traces. Use agent APIs to define custom errors, even when your function runs as expected. Rich alert ecosystem Build alerts using NRQL, allowing you to drive alerts based on custom attributes or any function-specific attribute.

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Features With New Relic, you get a wide variety of methods to analyze and present custom, real-time data visualizations. Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go. Our beautiful visualizations are accessible at any time, when you need them, or if you just want to show off your killer metrics. Download New Relic for your iPhone.

      "body": "Original user model This doc contains information about how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which pricing plan or user model you're on? See Overview of pricing plan and user models. View and manage users To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. User types: basic user and full user On the Users and roles UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. This only affects your account once you've switched to the New Relic One pricing plan, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. Your users on our original user model remain on that user model (and use these original user docs) and additionally have the new full/basic categorization. To learn more, see Transition to new pricing. You can also bulk update changes to user type. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select plus-circle New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles.

      "info": "How to use AWS managed policies to grant New Relic permission to monitor your AWS services with infrastructure integrations. ",
      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "How to use AWS managed policies to grant New Relic permission to monitor your AWS services with infrastructure integrations. ",
      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "Download latest version New Relic Diagnostics is a utility that automatically detects common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, see Not seeing data. New Relic Diagnostics running on Ubuntu Linux. nrdiag checks the configuration of your agents for issues and can generate zipped troubleshooting logs, ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility New Relic Diagnostics is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Diagnostics does not require superuser permissions to run, although New Relic does recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Run New Relic Diagnostics To use New Relic Diagnostics: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Recommendation: Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. Note that changing the logging level requires you to restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: Run with a task suite (CLI option) to scope your troubleshooting. New Relic Diagnostics automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. To run Diagnostics, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have New Relic Diagnostics: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS New Relic Diagnostics outputs issues it discovers to your terminal. If it doesn't, then include an attachment key as a CLI option. This will add relevant files to your support ticket for troubleshooting. macOS Ensure you have New Relic Diagnostics: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options, or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS New Relic Diagnostics outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have New Relic Diagnostics: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS New Relic Diagnostics outputs any issues it discovers, and it uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of New Relic Diagnostics. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS New Relic Diagnostics outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. View suites To review a list of available suites, run New Relic Diagnostics with the -help suites option. ./nrdiag --help suites Run suites Suites are run by providing the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. System Command line flag Linux, macOS For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with Diagnostics. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at rpm.newrelic.com, then select Help > Get support. Select View open tickets, then select the ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics results to your support ticket. Upload results to a support ticket If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when Diagnostics is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you would like to inspect or modify the contents of this file before upload, follow the manual upload process. System Command line flag Linux, macOS, Synthetics private minion ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Pass command line options These command line options are available for New Relic Diagnostics: Option Usage -a STRING -attachment-key STRING Attachment key for automatic upload to a support ticket. -browser-url STRING New Relic Diagnostics version 1.1.9 or higher When invoked, this will only run Browser-related Diagnostics checks.This command checks for the presence of the New Relic Browser agent and returns the agent version, the injection method (via APM or via copy/paste), and the Browser loader type (Pro, Lite, SPA). This can be used to provide detail to New Relic Support when troubleshooting intranet sites. -c STRING -config-file STRING Override default agent configuration file location. Can be used to specify either a folder to search in addition to the default folders, or a path to a specific configuration file. -file-upload STRING New Relic Diagnostics version 1.1.8 or higher Requires running with -a option. Allows upload of a single file at the path specified. This is in addition to files collected by default. --filter STRING Filter task results by result status. Accepts a comma separated list. Accepts: Success, Warning, Failure, Error, None. -h --help Displays full list of options. -help tasks will provide a full list of available tasks. -output-path STRING Specifies a different directory to write the results (nrdiag-output.zip, nrdiag-output.json and nrdiag-filelist.txt). Default location is ./ -o --override Pass in arguments to override. This should only generally be done when requested by New Relic Support. Example syntax: --override Java/Config/Agent.Status=Success -p STRING --proxy STRING Provide proxy to be used in HTTP connection tasks. Can be HTTP or HTTPS. Proxy should be in the format https://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT. If New Relic Diagnostics finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-pw STRING Proxy password, if necessary. If New Relic Diagnostics finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-user STRING Proxy username, if necessary. If New Relic Diagnostics finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -s STRING --suites STRING Run a suite, a collection of tasks that target specific products or issues. You can specify multiple suites by separating them with commas. For a list of all suites, run: ./nrdiag -h suites -t STRING --tasks STRING Run only a subset of tasks, either by agent or by task type. You can specify multiple tasks by separating them with commas. For a list of all tasks, run: ./nrdiag -h tasks -usage-opt-out Decline to send anonymous New Relic Diagnostic tool usage data to New Relic for this run. -v --verbose Display verbose logging during check execution. Disabled by default. --version Display current New Relic Diagnostics version. Will also prompt to check for a newer version and prompt to download if a newer version is available. -y --yes Say yes to any prompt that comes up while running. Disabled by default. Validate your config file settings New Relic Diagnostics now features more detailed configuration setting validation. Currently the Java agent's newrelic.yml file is supported, and support for other agents' configuration files is planned. If you run nrdiag in the usual manner - on the system running your application, with the New Relic agent already installed - the new validation will be applied automatically, and any warnings will be shown. You can also use this feature as a \"linter\" - to validate a config file before deployment - by running the appropriate task and providing the path to your config file. For example, if your newrelic.yml and nrdiag are both in the current directory, you can run the following command to lint the config file: ./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml. The screenshot below shows an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The agent_enabled setting in this case has a value of \"yes\", but the Java agent only accepts the values \"true\" or \"false\" - this misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running. When you've enabled your agent incorrectly, you'll see a message like this describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed. Interpret the output After executing New Relic Diagnostics from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a Warning or Failure status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation: New Relic Diagnostics outputs any issues it found with your installation, along with troubleshooting suggestions. File output New Relic Diagnostics outputs three files: Diagnostics output files Comments nrdiag-output.zip A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to support tickets. This archive also contains a copy of nrdiag-output.json nrdiag-output.json Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to tickets. nrdiag-filelist.txt A list of files found. The nrdiag-output.zip file that you attach to support tickets automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this .txt file separately. Result status codes New Relic Diagnostics returns the following status codes after running: Status code Definition Success Task successfully executed with no issues detected. Warning Task successfully executed. However, possible issues detected. Failure Task failed with issues detected. Error Task unable to execute. This could be due to a permissions issues. None Task was determined irrelevant to detected environment and was not executed. Run New Relic Diagnostics in a Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container you can use the docker exec command as follows: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Licensing and security The use of New Relic Diagnostics is subject to this license agreement, as well as licensing agreements for open-source software used by New Relic Diagnostics. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostic service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy. New Relic Diagnostics inspects system information and New Relic product artifacts (logs, config files) that are relevant for performing diagnostic checks that assess New Relic product configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. Data uploaded to support tickets Diagnostics does allow uploading of this information to a support ticket over HTTPS, with the use of a specific command-line argument. You will be prompted before collection of any files that we expect to have a likelihood of containing sensitive information. Before the collected files contained within nrdiag-output.zip are uploaded to New Relic, you will also be prompted. This allows you to review and edit any information that you do not want to provide. (For example, the nrdiag-output.zip will include your user name.) You also have the option to cancel the upload altogether. Data storage Any support ticket attachments made using Diagnostics or containing Diagnostics data that are less than or equal to 20MB are stored by Zendesk. Otherwise these attachments are stored by New Relic. For more information, see Zendesk's privacy and data protection policies. Environment variables New Relic Diagnostics examines the following environment variables to perform diagnostic checks. The values of these variables are recorded locally in the nrdiag-output.json file.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Implement cross application tracing To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. Obtain references to New Relic entities Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic entities.

Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

      "body": "Deployments of applications can be risky events. New Relic allows you to correlate those events to the performance of your applications, using deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Several options are available to manage your deployment data. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Notify your team of deployments Owners and Admins After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. Using a Personal API key with the REST API To use a Personal API key in any of the examples below, replace 'X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY' with 'Api-Key','YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY'. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'X-Api-Key'='YOUR_API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your Admin User's API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ADMIN_USERS_KEY\" \\ -i Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, the corresponding New Relic REST API key, Admin's API key, or Personal API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which New Relic Browser data was gathered. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browsers types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (Browser) data section than in the App server data section. Using a Personal API key with the REST API To use a Personal API key in any of the examples below, replace \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" with \"X-Api-Key:${PERSONALAPIKEY}\". Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each. REST API v2 commands Browser load time and page view count (v2) To obtain the Browser (EndUser/RUM) load time and page view count for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml\"\\ -H \"X-Api-Key:REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count&values[]=average_response_time&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count&values[]=average_response_time&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"x-api-key\"] = \"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str App response time and request count (v2) To obtain the Application response time and request count for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_response_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_response_time&values[]=call_count&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"x-api-key\"] = \"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str Apdex SLA data (v2) To obtain the Apdex related data for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"x-api-key\"] = \"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str REST API v1 commands (deprecated) REST API v1 is deprecated.

      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can see it directly on their homepage.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Distributed tracing Distributed tracing plays a very important role in the troubleshooting experience since it lets you dig into the communication pipe between the AWS Lambda function and any other artifact that function talks to during its execution. Distributed tracing also gives you valuable information regarding what each transaction is about, the time it takes to complete, and if there were errors. Inventoried Tags and Metadata We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Facet Builder New Relic’s Facet Builder for AWS Lambda instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom insights—without having to write queries. Metrics, events, and other measurement High cardinality invocation data View throughput, detailed categorized AWS Lambda performance metrics like duration, cold starts, error rate and more at any transaction percentile. Filter and facet by tags and function metadata to rapidly find the answer you’re looking for. AWS CloudWatch Metrics We capture metrics harvested from AWS CloudWatch for over 30 connected AWS services including AWS Lambda, allowing you to understand the performance of event-driven architectures that include queues and data streams. Key event AWS Lambda metrics like iterator age, dead letter errors / dead letter queue depth, and throttles can be visualized along performance data from instrumentation in your functions. Custom attributes and custom events Capture and send custom attributes or events and tag their function invocations with attributes, so you can connect your performance data to specific business KPIs, or understand the performance of specific functionality within your function. Errors and alerts Rich error analysis View all the errors that occurred in your function code and analyze all the details and error traces. Use agent APIs to define custom errors, even when your function runs as expected. Rich alert ecosystem Build alerts using NRQL, allowing you to drive alerts based on custom attributes or any function-specific attribute.

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent. Additional Event API requirements For more requirements and details for the Event API, see Event API. Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Features With New Relic, you get a wide variety of methods to analyze and present custom, real-time data visualizations. Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data, which is then available for querying in New Relic. Related documentation: Add custom attributes to existing events Send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM) Custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Data considerations The New Relic agents sends event data to New Relic as part of its normal harvest cycle every 5 seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record a custom event To record a custom event, follow the procedure for your New Relic language agent: C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml:​ custom_insights_events: enabled: false For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Features With New Relic, you get a wide variety of methods to analyze and present custom, real-time data visualizations. Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go. Our beautiful visualizations are accessible at any time, when you need them, or if you just want to show off your killer metrics. Download New Relic for your iPhone.

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn about how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see Event data retention.

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent. Additional Event API requirements For more requirements and details for the Event API, see Event API. Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Loss of signal Use the signal loss settings to: Set the signal loss time limit Close all current open violations Open new violations To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise and descriptive condition name. Choose how long data is collected before it's aggregated. Adjust the evaluation offset. Select whether or not to fill gaps with data and what values to use. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Sometimes a signal will have an aggregation window that does not contain data. This creates a gap in the data that is evaluated. This feature allows you to fill gaps in data with either the last known or a custom value that you choose. It is common to use a zero as the custom value. The default behavior is to leave gaps empty, which will restart the evaluation duration timer. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by New Relic. Sometimes, there's no data being sent and sometimes data is being lost. You can use loss of signal to customize whether and when you'll be notified after your last known signal. To create a NRQL alert that uses loss of signal: When creating a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Create a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the time in minutes or seconds after which the signal will be considered lost. When the signal is lost, check the boxes to Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. Make sure you name your condition and then save it. You can use a signal loss to close all of your currently open violations, open a lost signal violation, or do both. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Nested Aggregation NRQL Alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data and open up new possibilities to alert on. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query will produce a single result thus giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. Registering the inner query alone would be equivalent. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window Assuming the alert is registered with an aggregation window of 1 minute, this inner query would produce 2 smaller windows of width 30 seconds which could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems. For details, see Description.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction New Relic Browser events, like PageView New Relic Mobile events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:​ SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent. Additional Event API requirements For more requirements and details for the Event API, see Event API. Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.

Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Additional account conditions: Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics.

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query and facet this type of data. To explore timeslice data in the data explorer, see Explore your metrics. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile, and Browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also incorporate NRQL queries in our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API. How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Here's another example of a faceted wildcard query: This shows a NRQL query of metric timeslice data that facets the rate of Flask functions by the wildcarded process name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

Back to top icon Article Tips and Tricks for Monitoring AWS with New Relic Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications. Links Download PDF Whether you’re a seasoned New Relic user or are just starting to understand how the New Relic platform works, there’s always a new tip or trick you can use to improve the performance of your cloud-hosted applications. Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications: 1. Right-size your AWS instances The transient nature of EC2 instances can make it difficult to get an accurate view of your AWS ecosystem. Your company may have many different individuals or groups who are spinning up EC2 instances for various purposes. Because of this, a complete view of the current state of your AWS environment is essential. A decommissioned host is not a “dead” server; rather, it has merely served its purpose. Using New Relic Infrastructure, you instantly get an accurate snapshot of your EC2 instances, which allows you to then dissect them by the AWS tags you already use. Ultimately, this 360-degree view of your infrastructure allows you to optimize (or right-size) your AWS instances for maximum ROI. 2. Monitor all the (AWS) things While EC2 powers most AWS workloads, it’s by no means the only AWS service used to power modern applications. To fully understand how your AWS ecosystem is performing, you need to monitor the other services you use. New Relic Infrastructure Professional allows you to monitor the performance health of many popular AWS services, such as CloudFront, DynamoDB, EBS, ElastiCache, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), IAM, Kinesis, RDS, SNS, SQS, and VPC, to name just a few of the services New Relic can monitor. To use these services effectively, you need context. For example, AWS ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, which you don’t always have visibility into. But by tracking ELB requests per second as well as write and read volume in New Relic Insights, you can understand exactly how that load is being balanced to make sure you’re using the service as effectively as possible. 3. Set up auto-scaling alerts and dashboards Ops teams depend on critical alerts and custom dashboards to tell the whole story about infrastructure performance. That’s why New Relic makes it easy for you to set thresholds for alerts on various metrics relating to your applications, servers, and key transactions. As EC2 instances come and go, your alerts and dashboards need to auto-scale with them. You can manage alerts by creating specified user groups and by leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels, including OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Slack, VictorOps, and Campfire. If you’re using a different alerting solution, use our Webhook feature to send a JSON Object anywhere you choose. New Relic also gives you the option to create customized dashboards for a curated view of what you care about most when running your applications in an AWS ecosystem. 4. Automate your setup When you’re operating in a dynamic AWS environment, your underlying infrastructure is constantly shifting. While AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning the resources, it raises the obvious question of how your application software is deployed, configured, and executed on your Amazon EC2 instances. That’s why you should consider using an automation solution like Chef or Puppet, which can automatically configure your systems and apps that sit on top of your infrastructure. Both tools make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. When these config management tools are combined with New Relic Infrastructure, you get an instant view of your EC2 metrics, as well as the change events associated with their configuration. 5. Keep an eye on the entire stack The great thing about using New Relic to monitor your AWS applications is that it doesn’t just give you visibility into a certain portion of your application stack, but lets you see the entire thing—even if you’re running in a hybrid cloud, on-premise, or both. If you spot a performance problem in New Relic APM, for example, you can easily correlate to issues with your infrastructure using New Relic Infrastructure. You can test your application from outside the firewall using New Relic Synthetics, see what’s going on at the interaction level using New Relic Browser, and also organize, query, and visualize all this data using New Relic Insights to answer key questions about application and customer experience—all in real time. Performance monitoring for AWS Build, migrate, and deploy your applications and infrastructure faster with AWS monitoring from New Relic.

Standardize application-naming conventions 2. Add labels to your applications 3. Create and evaluate alert policies 4. Identify and set up key transactions 5. Leverage New Relic’s reporting capabilities 6. Look at your environment holistically 7. Keep your agents current 8. Automate user management and single sign-on Download PDF Introduction Whether it’s outages, crashes, or lags, organizations with unreliable software won’t have users for very long. Manually troubleshooting complex software or relying on customer complaints during urgent incidents is not only incredibly stressful, it virtually guarantees your users will flee for a competitor before you even have time to resolve the issue. New Relic APM gives your modern development team the visibility needed to address problems quickly and proactively before they impact your users. In turn, you’re able do your job more effectively while improving the overall user experience. For software engineers, SREs, and DevOps professionals, New Relic APM provides real-time data about your application performance and the level of satisfaction that your end users experience. Our automatic instrumentation gives you built-in dashboards to see how your app is performing, whether it’s built in Java, Python, Go, or any of our supported languages. Combined with opinionated workflows, New Relic APM quickly detects anomalies, discovers deficiencies, and helps you identify ways to improve performance on key metrics for business-critical applications and distributed services. For those just entering the world of APM, it can seem pretty daunting. We get it, and we’re here to provide support on your journey from APM beginner to APM wizard. Once you’ve installed the New Relic APM agent, start by following these pointers to get the most out of this powerful tool. 1. Standardize application-naming conventions Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as “My Application” or “PHP Application” if you don’t specify the name in your New Relic configuration file. You don’t want to end up with 20 applications that all have the same name, so always be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, we also recommend standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in staging have [Staging] at the end of their name). Ideally, you want your new applications named automatically, rather than manually, to help cut down the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. HOW TO DO IT: 1. For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best with your needs and follow these steps. 2. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods so refer to the documentation for your agent. For non-Java apps, there’s no automatic naming but you can set the app name via a script to ensure consistency. For info about which config methods to use, see the documentation for your specific agent. 2. Add labels to your applications When you’ve got several different applications using the same account and each application spans multiple environments (e.g., development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That’s why we recommend adding labels to your apps so you can organize them by segmenting them into logical groups. The two most common labels that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in test, you could simply filter by “billing app” (name label) and “test” (environment label). New Relic APM is designed so that account owners and admins can label apps so they “roll up” into an unlimited number of meaningful categories. You can also easily sort, filter, and page through all applications on your account’s Applications list. HOW TO DO IT: From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications. From the Applications index, select Show Labels > On. To assign an app to a category, select the circled plus icon by its name. Follow the guidelines to type the label; use the format Category:Value. To save the new label, press Enter or Return. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies Most of your alerts are going to be based on your Apdex score, which measures users’ satisfaction with the response time of your application. Apdex T is the central value for Apdex—you want to make sure you set it at a value that is meaningful to your specific app. We recommend setting your Apdex T value to 0.95 seconds to strive for true optimization. Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you’re taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels. Just be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. And, if you’re interested in helping your on-call teams detect, diagnose, and respond to incidents faster, check out New Relic Applied Intelligence (AI). HOW TO DO IT: Change your Apdex settings. Set up your alert notification channels. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic’s key transactions feature is designed to let you closely monitor what you decide are your app’s most business-critical transactions, whether that’s end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, and more. You can also create alerts to notify you when your key transactions are performing poorly. HOW TO DO IT: From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Key transactions, and select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction. OR from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Leverage New Relic’s reporting capabilities From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools to surface historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports available, and use them to your advantage. HOW TO DO IT: To view a report, from the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you’d like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 6. Look at your environment holistically The great thing about using New Relic to monitor your applications is that it doesn’t just give you visibility into a certain portion of your application stack, but into the entirety of it. Say you’re an Amazon Web Services (AWS) user. New Relic Integrations offer a number of useful ways to give you added visibility into your AWS applications. From mobile and browser monitoring to synthetics testing and more, the New Relic platform is designed to provide end-to-end visibility into the performance of your applications. HOW TO DO IT: If you aren’t using any New Relic products beyond APM, sign up for other solutions that pique your interest. Many New Relic products offer a free demo and trial, which you can use to test out the solution before purchasing it. Once all products are deployed, you can easily switch between different New Relic products using the menu bar on the top of your overview screen. 7. Keep your agents current Most likely, your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Running the latest agents ensures that you have access to all our instrumentation, API methods, and bug fixes. (To see the latest improvements we’ve shipped to our agents, see our release notes.) Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. HOW TO DO IT: 1. Regularly review which version of the agent you’re using to know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or some additional functionality you want, download it. 2. To deploy the agent manually, see our instructions for full details. 3. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors), you can either: Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Check out our documentation for your agent to see what steps your script will need. 4. Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless the script handles this). 5. Run the deployment script. 6. Start the application (unless the script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back the version to the previous version. 8. Automate user management and single sign-on New Relic supports the SCIM 2.0 standard for automatically provisioning users and the SAML 2.0 standard to allow single sign-on (SSO). By configuring the New Relic SCIM/SSO application for your identity provider, you can automatically send New Relic any user permission changes you make within the identity provider. New Relic users can then be created, updated, and deactivated from your identity provider, without the separate step of having to use a New Relic UI or API. In addition, users can log in to New Relic by just clicking on the SCIM/SSO application tile from their identity provider home page. HOW TO DO IT: To get started with SCIM and SSO, you’ll need to work with your account representative on configuration by providing a list of the New Relic account IDs associated with your organization. For full details, check out Automated User Management. To obtain a SAML certificate, start by viewing a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration by going to the New Relic title bar, selecting (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on. To integrate with an SAML provider, you’ll need to provide information about your New Relic account, which you can learn more about in Integrating with a SAML Provider for SSO.

Because of this need to reduce downtime (with less manual intervention) as systems scale, a new role is taking shape in many organizations: the site reliability engineer (SRE). The phrase “site reliability engineering” is credited to Benjamin Treynor Sloss, vice president of engineering at Google. Sloss joined Google in 2003 and was tasked with building a team to help ensure the health of Google’s production systems at scale—no small task. According to Sloss, site reliability engineering is “what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function.” Site reliability engineering is a cross-functional role, assuming responsibilities traditionally siloed off to development, operations, and other IT groups. The proliferation of the SRE No matter how you define it, the SRE role is clearly expanding into more and more companies. A recent jobs search for “Site Reliability Engineer” on Glassdoor produced more than 61,600 open positions at the time of this writing. Tech firms are certainly well represented—companies from Adobe to GitHub to Spotify (and plenty more) are all hiring SREs. But you’ll also see plenty of other bellwether companies (such as GE, Chase, Walmart, and McGraw-Hill Education) and industries (including entertainment and education) seeking SRE practitioners, too. And it’s no surprise that companies of all shapes and sizes are starting to adopt the role. “My impression is that there’s a slow trickle-down to smaller companies,” says Beth Long, a software engineer with New Relic’s Reliability Engineering team. “Google and Netflix and Amazon and Heroku—these companies have had SREs for a long time because they have the resources and the scale that demand it. You’re starting to see that role appear in smaller companies where they realize ‘Oh, we need someone to play this role.’” As a result, folks with the right mix of talent and experience for the SRE role are increasingly in demand. Not too long ago TechCrunch asked, “Are site reliability engineers the next data scientists?” And last year LinkedIn named SRE as one of the most promising jobs in tech. From Google to the rest of the world Sloss’ team literally wrote the book on site reliability engineering. So if you’re wondering what a great modern SRE practice should look like in a DevOps world, the Google Site Reliability Engineering book is a fantastic point of reference. In it, Sloss writes, “It is a truth universally acknowledged that systems do not run themselves. How, then, should a system—particularly a complex computing system that operates at a large scale—be run?” Google’s answer has been to hire software engineers to do the work usually handled in traditional organizations by IT operations folks. “Our Site Reliability Engineering teams focus on hiring software engineers to run our products and to create systems to accomplish the work that would otherwise be performed, often manually, by sysadmins,” explains Sloss. Starting the SRE journey While job descriptions and day-to-day tasks for SREs vary from company to company, the utility of the role is quickly becoming apparent to those software organizations who’ve adopted it. So where does that leave you? Whether you’re still figuring out how to create a site reliability practice at your company or you’re trying to improve the processes and habits of an existing SRE team, the more you know about the subject the better—especially since what may work for a massive company like Google may not always work for a small or mid-sized outfit. To that end, this ebook shares the philosophies, habits, and tools of successful SREs, along with New Relic’s own definition, guidelines, and expectations for the role. Chapter 1: SRE Philosophy and Principles Is SRE the purest form of DevOps? As vice president of site reliability, Matthew Flaming oversees New Relic’s SRE practice. He believes site reliability engineering is perhaps “the purest distillation of DevOps principles into a single role. And it’s something we try very hard to empower both internally in the organization and for our customers.” In a conversation with Flaming last year at FutureStack: New York, Liz Fong- Jones, a staff SRE at Google, helped extend this thought. While Google’s software engineers always take responsibility for their code and reliability of their production systems, she said, SREs are charged with developing a particularly specialized depth of understanding of how different systems work together, how they fail, how they can be improved, and how they can best be designed and monitored—expertise that they must then share with their counterparts who are more focused on product development. That latter part is the key reason SREs are so often embedded into product teams. SREs might take on software engineering tasks, but they’re also charged with growing automation-first practices that reduce toil and improve reliability for the services offered by engineering teams. The fundamental goal is greater reliability with less manual intervention as a system scales. The two axes of scaling According to Flaming, there are two types, or “axes,” of scale that software organizations must plan for. The first axis is workload—the number of physical hosts or virtual machines and other resources that must be able to grow efficiently in concert with the services that run on them. The second axis is complexity—the number of dependencies between those services and the growth of the organization itself. Fundamentally, site reliability engineering is about enabling both forms of scalability. Fong-Jones supports that idea based on lessons learned during her early days at Google, circa 2009 while working on the Bigtable database service. Back then there was a lot of manual effort involved in running Bigtable as a shared service throughout the company, she said. The footprint was still relatively small, but it quickly became apparent that it would have trouble scaling. The non-SRE (or non-DevOps) solution would have been “Let’s hire some more sysadmins to help handle this torrent of incoming tickets.” But that approach is just throwing more people at a problem, not actually solving it for long-term scalability. Scalability, Fong-Jones goes on to say, typically boils down to automation: “The evolution over 10 years of ‘how do we go from handling dozens of footprints to hundreds or thousands of footprints?’ is ‘Let’s automate.’” Resource management, self-service provisioning, and other areas are important to scaling, too. Giving infrastructure ownership back to teams so that they had visibility into their workloads and could allocate and manage their own resources more effectively, rather than just firing off requests to an ops team, was a critical part of her experience on the Bigtable project, Fong-Jones said. The shift made those client teams happier, too, because they were more empowered to self-govern their infrastructure. Self governance, according to Fong-Jones, requires creating standards for processes and tooling (covered later in this ebook). “One SRE team is going to have a really difficult time supporting 50 different software engineering teams if they’re each doing their own separate thing and they’re each using separate tooling,” she said. Her team formalized the best practices that would enable them to scale and reach as many of their product development software engineering colleagues as possible. Chapter 2: What Makes an SRE Successful First-class technical chops are obviously critical in most development and operations roles. But for an SRE, a candidate’s technical contributions will depend on how a particular organization defines or approaches the role: one company might require more software engineering and coding experience, whereas another organization might place a higher value on operations or QA skills. Whatever the balance, what sets the “great” apart from the “good enough” is often a combination of habits and traits that complement technical expertise. Here’s how you’ll know you’ve found a fantastic SRE: SREs see the (much) bigger picture Successful software developers understand how their code helps drive the overall business, and great SREs have their own version of this trait. “You’re looking for someone who is really thinking about the bigger picture outside of the day-to-day,” says Jason Qualman, a site reliability engineer at New Relic. “A successful SRE is someone who can understand and interpret things at a higher level.” Changes can create risks or impacts down the road, not just in that current moment, and a good SRE is sure to perform a thorough analysis before making any changes. The ability to consider how their work is going to affect the rest of a particular system, team, or the larger infrastructure is the kind of extreme pragmatism SREs need. There’s little long-term upside in a siloed approach that throws a change over the wall with no concern for how it might affect the person sitting on the other side. “We are making decisions very low in the stack,” Qualman says of the SRE. Those decisions will affect people much further up the stack. Good decisions enable seamless transitions. SREs automate at every opportunity Top-notch SREs successfully increase the reliability of everything they touch without slowing their company’s ability to ship software quickly. And they do it with automation—great SREs are proactive about automating away painful manual tasks and toil. “A lot of this role is thinking about inefficient and time-consuming things people are doing and putting a stop to them as soon as possible,” Qualman says. “Instead of kicking a can down the road on manual work, you’re saying, ‘I’m going to take the time to automate this right now and stop anyone else from having to do this painful thing.’” This obsessive focus on automation is a key tenet of SRE—and DevOps— philosophy; in fact, The DevOps Handbook has a chapter that discusses the counterintuitive effects of manual acceptance processes. And “automation” and its variants seem to appear more often than any other word in SRE job descriptions. It’s not that unexpected to see “Automate, automate, automate, and then … automate!” as a key responsibility in an SRE job listing. SREs embrace new tools and approaches (when necessary) Since site reliability engineering is still fairly new, many engineers who currently hold the title worked in other jobs before assuming the role. Some SREs might have a developer background while others may come from traditional operations backgrounds, so hiring managers are best served by not pigeonholing the SRE role to one particular background. A traditional QA engineer might have a good makeup for the SRE position, for example. No matter your background, though, the SRE role should challenge you to move out of your comfort zone and develop new skills. An operations practitioner might benefit from learning a programming language or three, for instance, while someone with a development background should be willing and able to think much more deeply about operational processes and challenges than they did in the past. The best SREs embrace this kind of broad-based learning and skills development. SREs are change agents The confidence to advocate for SRE initiatives is another skill that distinguishes the best SREs. Great SREs live their own engineering-centric version of the self-help classic How to Win Friends and Influence People. Part of the job, simply put, involves convincing other people to do things they initially might not want to do; for example, convincing a software engineer focused on quickly shipping a product feature to think about ways to scale that feature over the next several years. Great SREs have to be effective salespeople; they have to be able to sell their colleagues on processes and projects that might appear to involve some near-term pain or go against legacy norms. “You need to be able to dig in and say, ‘stop’ and ‘no,’ which can be difficult to do in some engineering organizations,” says Beth Long. For an SRE, part of being pragmatic means being willing to dump processes, procedures, and tools that may have been well intentioned but are no longer productive. Pets vs. Cattle The importance of automation reflects the shift in how IT infrastructure is maintained in a modern software environment. You could treat all your servers as “pets,” each with its own unique maintenance and configuration requirements, but today SRE and DevOps practitioners have evolved the best practice to treat servers as “cattle,” where a herd of basically indistinguishable servers is configured en masse through automation. But servers aren’t the only thing SREs automate—their goal is to automate all the little things that could get in their way: testing environments, packaging processes, user creation, bug tracking, and the list goes on… Chapter 3: SRE Tools and Processes Just as there’s no universal job description for SREs, there’s no standard toolset for the role either. However, great SREs always seek to optimize reliability tools and processes, and evangelize them throughout the organization. It makes absolute sense—optimization is key to a successful SRE practice and for proper implementation of DevOps principles. But what tools should SREs standardize on? Each team needs to decide what’s best for them. The good news is, there are plenty of choices. Stages of the DevOps (and SRE) toolchain If you created a “stages of the SRE toolchain,” it probably wouldn’t surprise you if it looked a lot like the DevOps toolchain, especially if you share Matthew Flaming’s belief that site reliability engineering is really just DevOps expressed in its purest form. At New Relic, SREs play an increasingly important role that combines responsibilities once siloed in traditional dev and ops teams. As a result, there isn’t much difference between a “DevOps toolchain” and an “SRE toolchain,” Flaming says. Plan: Agile project management and tracking tools like JIRA or Pivotal Tracker, or other task management tools. Create: Integrated development environments (IDEs), text editors, and shared libraries and components—as New Relic VP Henry Shapiro describes them: “the building blocks that you use to actually build applications.” Even here, SREs have a role to play, such as encouraging development teams to avoid building everything from scratch in favor of reusing reliable code or third-party libraries. Source-control tools like GitHub and Subversion help erase boundaries between dev and ops roles, and enjoy significant popularity among SREs tasked with managing deployment environments and processes. Verify: Build and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins or CircleCI. Package: Tools to manage the build, packaging, release staging, and approval process of production-ready software, such as Rake or JFrog. Release: Tools to manage releases and the lifecycle of an application, like Apache Maven or XebiaLabs. Configure: Tools like Terraform and Ansible fit the “automate, automate, automate” SRE philosophy, and enable teams to automate and manage configurations across infrastructure and applications. SREs play an important role in determining what those configuration should look like from a health and reliability perspective. These tools also help automate away much of the manual work formerly needed to implement necessary rules and processes. Both Shapiro and Qualman note that the increasing use of containers may ultimately reduce the need for these tools in many organizations. Because containerized applications include all of their dependencies and configurations in immutable configurations, container platforms like Docker and orchestration services like Kubernetes or Mesosphere are becoming indispensable to SREs Monitor: Monitoring can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but Shapiro notes that this stage includes tools like New Relic that collect metrics from applications and infrastructure in some form of log or analytics data, and alerts on that data via configurable dashboards and queries. Using SLOs and SLIs to measure reliability Service level objectives (SLOs) are a common way to measure the performance of a service provider and can be equally important to site reliability engineering success. Clearly defined and measured SLO metrics at the product and service level help organizations to: Tune investment and overall prioritization to meet reliability goals, and to meaningfully adjust those high-level reliability goals to fit company strategy. Maintain and build customers’ confidence. Help teams decide when and how to focus efforts on reliability. Help engineers make better assumptions about risk tolerance and how fast they can go, as well as reason better about dependencies and reduce unnecessary toil. If teams consistently exceed their SLOs (for example, 99.9% availability for all services), they may be able to move faster and take on more risk. If a team is in danger, or isn’t meeting its SLOs, it’s a signal to back off and pause to focus on reliability so that the team can start moving faster again. Service level indicators (SLIs) can also be used to measure reliability. These performance metrics track some facet of the business; for example, an SLI for a database service could be something like, “The fraction of user queries that are successfully completed within 200 milliseconds without error.” To measure reliability, teams turn to metrics like mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and mean time to detect (MTTD), all of which help organizations define their “risk matrices.” These become powerful tools for prioritizing issues and risks that will have a quantifiable impact on SLOs, but they also allow organizations to downshift on issues that may not be especially urgent. Nothing is written in stone The tools SREs use at any given time will depend on where an organization is at in their SRE journey. Less mature organizations will tend to use more specialized operations tools while more mature organizations will see more convergence between SRE and software engineering toolchains. So while it’s certain that there’s no “one size fits all” set of tools, SREs should experiment with and adopt the right tools as they seek new, efficient ways to bring greater reliability to everything they do. Chapter 4: The SRE Role at New Relic Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book does a great job of outlining what a great modern SRE practice should look like in a DevOps world. But what about SRE practices at companies that aren’t the size of Google? For all that’s been written about reliability practices, it’s surprisingly hard to find specific, detailed descriptions of the day-to-day role that SREs play in other engineering organizations. Most descriptions on the internet contain relatively vague phrases like, “SREs combine software engineering and operational skill sets” and “SREs automate all the things.” Matthew Flaming has put a lot of thought into how New Relic defines the role so all stakeholders—from potential candidates to executive leadership— can understand exactly what New Relic expects for, and from, their SREs. Defining the role Creating the New Relic SRE description took time and involved input from individual SREs as well as executive leadership. This was a worthwhile investment, Flaming says, as the exercise helped clarify and shape a shared understanding of: Why SREs are important at New Relic. The vision for an SRE team. How SREs can most effectively contribute to the future of the New Relic platform. SREs at New Relic are engineers who focus on, and are recognized primarily for, improving the reliability of our systems. From a business perspective, the goal of the work that SREs do is to build and maintain customers’ trust, and to allow the business to scale by steadily decreasing the per-service and per-host operational overhead of New Relic’s platform. At a high level, SREs make this happen by: Championing reliability best practices. Guiding designs and processes with an eye toward resilience and low toil. Reducing technical complexity and sprawl. Driving the usage of tooling and common components. Implementing software and tooling to improve resilience and automate operations. Set your SREs up for success Although this SRE role description works well at New Relic, it may not be right for other organizations. Regardless, it provides a useful example and helps clarify the tremendous value a great SRE practice can bring. By developing your own guidelines, can set SREs up for success and advance the collective understanding of the key role the SRE practice will play as it matures to support the ever-increasing complexity of computing platforms. Finally, it’s critical to create a community of practice, and mentor/mentee relationships, for SREs and others who care deeply about reliability and share best practices with each other—that’s what really creates a culture of reliability. Conclusion Once you define the SRE role and have the right organizational structure and incentives in place, it all comes down to execution. A successful SRE team depends on a variety of skills and traits. You can always teach technical skills, but you can’t necessarily impart equally essential qualities like empathy and curiosity. Some engineering cultures, like New Relic’s, prize autonomy, but that doesn’t mean teams should have to tackle reliability on their own. Teams (and individual SREs) need organizational support, communication, and, above all, trust in order to thrive. A guiding philosophy for successful SREs might be expressed this way: Don’t chase a holy grail—you can’t prevent things from ever breaking. Instead, work tirelessly to see the big picture, incorporate automation, encourage healthy patterns, learn new skills and tools, and improve reliability in everything that you do. Perfection may be unattainable, but constantly striving to do things better is the way to get as close as possible. Successful DevOps starts here Measure what matters and innovate faster.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

Back to top icon WHITE PAPER How the Telemetry Data Platform Is Built for Scale and Flexibility Introduction How Telemetry Data Platform Is Purpose-Built for Time Series Data Unified Telemetry: The Key Data Types of Telemetry Data Platform NRQL: Your Gateway to Telemetry Data Platform Additional Resources and Reading Introduction Today, application and data infrastructures are as complex as they’ve ever been, creating an abundance of data about their internal workings. As such, monitoring practices have evolved, leading DevOps teams, application developers, and operations and infrastructure teams to adopt observability best practices. One crucial practice of observability is to instrument everything in your stack.  However, trying to handle all this data on your own will only present another set of challenges. Are you recording the right data in the right formats? Is your data pipeline big enough to handle the load as your demand on your software increases? At New Relic, we believe observability should reduce anxiety instead of adding to it.  To that end, you need a single observability platform, with a unified database, that: Gathers all your telemetry data in one place, giving you a connected view of all the data points in your system, so you can identify, understand, and resolve the issues that impact your business Is built on a flexible schema, so you can get fast answers to questions that you never had to ask before Scales as your business grows, and does so without limits to support any unpredictable demands on your business Such capabilities are the defining functions of Telemetry Data Platform. Telemetry Data Platform, the world’s most powerful platform to analyze operational data Telemetry Data Platform is the powerhouse driving New Relic One. We call it the world’s most powerful telemetry platform for a reason: Its median query response time is lightning-fast (60 milliseconds), and its 99% percentile response time is less than two seconds. For very large queries—those scanning over 50 billion records—99% finish in less than 30 seconds. Telemetry Data Platform ingests over 1 billion data points per minute, so when any customer experiences increased demand, Telemetry Data Platform handles the incremental hundreds of millions of data points with ease. Behind the scenes, Telemetry Data Platform is a very large distributed system—a multi-tenant cloud service on which a large query will run on thousands of CPU cores concurrently, allowing it to process billions of records in seconds.  We designed Telemetry Data Platform to scale without limits to support the unpredictable demand of our customers around the globe. As our customer base has grown over the past decade, from retail to entertainment, apparel to healthcare, and gaming to e-commerce, we have scaled Telemetry Data Platform. And because of its multi-tenant architecture, our smallest customers benefit from the same massive computing resources as our largest customers.  Whether you are starting on a single host, a single app, or running an enterprise with tens of thousands of hosts and application instances, Telemetry Data Platform supports your needs. As your business and data grow, Telemetry Data Platform will scale to support your business requirements.  So, how does Telemetry Data Platform do all this? In this white paper, we explain: The data model behind Telemetry Data Platform The telemetry data types stored in Telemetry Data Platform The SQL-like query language that makes querying large amounts of data a breeze The key resources for learning how to ingest and query Telemetry Data Platform How Telemetry Data Platform Is Purpose-Built for Time Series Data A good database provides so much more than data storage and retrieval. A good database provides value-add services, like analytics and aggregation, so teams can offload heavy computing to the database server. A database’s query functionality is another critical aspect of its utility, and that query power is dictated by its data model. Telemetry Data Platform stores time series data—a series of data points indexed in time order—which is an important class of telemetry data. In this section, we summarize three different models for time series data and explain why we settled on the one that works best: a relational model with a flexible schema.  Note: In this section, the examples require discussion of metrics, aggregated sets of measurements grouped or collected at regular intervals. We’ll further discuss metrics—as well as other telemetry data types—and their relationship to Telemetry Data Platform later in this white paper.  One-dimensional, time series-centric model: Simply not enough As we defined it above, time series data is data that’s indexed in a series of particular time periods or intervals.  Consider the following example, where each row represents a time series. Each time series is identified by a metric name and several tags.  Metric name Tags Time series (time:value pairs) cpuTime host=server1, dataCenter=east t1:22, t2:14, t3:34, ... cpuTime host=server2, dataCenter=east t1:37, t2:11, t3:94, ... responseTime database=mysql, data=inventory t1:15, t2:45, t3:90, t4:57... ... ... ... A typical query API provides mechanisms to select time series by name or filter and to “group by” tags. If you need to query a single metric name, this works well, but if you need to query multiple metric names at once, it’s not so useful. For example, imagine you have two metrics: cpuTimeSpent and numRequestsProcessed. Suppose you want to observe per request cpu cost change over time. Conceptually, doing so is just a simple division: cpuTimeSpent / numRequestsProcessed. But expressing this formula to query time series data is not easy. In many systems, the client will retrieve both time series, and then do the division on the client side. In fact, we’ve seen examples in which it takes 20 lines of code to do a retrieval and division like this. (Some databases use vector matching to deal with multiple metrics. Functionally, this works, but it requires mental acrobatics from the user.) From a programming language point of view, the shortcoming of a time series-centric model is that it only supports one-dimensional array; in other words, a time series is an array indexed by one dimension—time. When dealing with multiple arrays, any system that uses this model has to resort to convoluted mechanisms, like vector matching to correlate elements in the arrays. This isn’t great for applications: “While these systems provided some of the benefits of a database system, they lacked many traditional database features that application developers often rely on,” write the authors of Google’s Spanner: Becoming a SQL System. “A key example is a robust query language, meaning that developers had to write complex code to process and aggregate the data in their applications.”   Relational model, fixed schema: Too many tables to stitch together Because querying one-dimensional data imposes severe limitations, some databases use a relational model for time series data. In this model, each data point is presented as a row in a relational table with the timestamp and tags presented in columns. For example: time host dataCenter cpuTime memoryUsed t1 server1 east 17 2078 t2 server2 east 48 3810 ... ... ... ... ... With this approach, you get full power from SQL, but you need to explicitly run a create table statement for each metric and tag schema. This is more than just inconvenient: If you have a large number of schemas, you’ll have a large number of tables, which stresses the database. Similarly, if you run a schema change (alter table), you’ll have performance problems at scale. You’ll also find that multi-metric queries are still a problem. Although this model allows multiple metrics in one table (as shown in the example above), there will be times when you need to query across tables because one schema does not fit all data. Consider this scenario: You have a host table for host metrics and an application table for application metrics, such as numRequests. To compute cpuTime / numRequests, you’ll need to do a SQL join on the time column to stitch the two tables together. Unless rows in the two tables always have exactly matching timestamps, you’ll need to apply a time_bucket() function on the time column to snap timestamps to the time bucket boundary. For example: select time_bucket(‘1 hour’, hostTable.time) as bucketTime, sum(cpuTime) / sum(numRequests) from hostTable, applicationTable where time_bucket(‘1 hour’, processTable.time) = bucketTime group by bucketTime order by bucketTime This example shows the non-intuitive way of using group by on time to generate a time series. In contrast, the New Relic Query Language (NRQL)—which we provide more detail about below—uses an intuitive timeseries clause to query time series across multiple tables. Telemetry Data Platform's secret sauce: Relational model with flexible schema To solve the problem of multiple tables, Telemetry Data Platform uses a relational model with a flexible schema. In this model, rows in a table don’t have to use the same schema. In fact, to be even more user friendly, there is no create table statement at all. When Telemetry Data Platform's database ingests a new column, it’s automatically added to the table’s schema. Essentially, Telemetry Data Platform uses the union of schemas from all rows as the table schema. In Telemetry Data Platform’s flexible schema (as shown in the following example), each row represents a data point. Row 1 holds the cpuTime metric, with host and dataCenter tags. Row 2 holds the appRequests metric, with host and appName tags. (The metricName column is a metadata column, which we’ll explain in the “Schema Introspection” section of this document.) time metricName cpuTime host dataCenter appName appRequests t1 cpuTime 27 server1 east     t2 appRequests   server1   invoiceApp 78 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... If a column is not present on a row, its value is null (illustrated by the gray cells). The “is null” and “is not null” operators work as usual. For example, to get metric names of all metrics with a host tag, you can run select uniques(metricName) where host is not null. From a programming language point of view, this is a two-dimensional array. Because every metric is present on the table schema, you can compose fairly simple multi-metric queries. For example, to use NRQL to produce time series data of per request CPU cost, you could run: From Metric select sum(cpuTime) / sum(appRequests) timeseries In the monitoring industry, “dimensional” metrics refer to metric data with attributes attached as key:value pairs, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. Telemetry Data Platform supports dimensional metrics from the following sources: Open source integrations New Relic’s Telemetry SDKs New Relic’s Metric API (the underlying API used by the tools above)   Schema introspection: Metadata is a first-class citizen in New Relic When Telemetry Data Platform ingests data, it automatically generates table schema based on that data using the keyset() function for schema introspection, which returns column names and types. The function is called “keyset” because a row can also be seen as a list of key:value pairs, where both keys and values are represented as column names, and the function returns the key set. The keyset() function takes rows as input and produces a schema (a list of columns with name and type) as output, similar to object introspection in some programming languages. Together with the MetricName column (available in the “Metric” table only), Telemetry Data Platform provides rich metadata query features, and users can apply the full power of NRQL analytics on schema introspection. Here are just a few examples gathered with NRQL: NRQL query Usage select keyset() from myTable This query returns the schema of rows timestamped in the past hour; since 1 hour ago is the default time window for a query. select keyset() from myTable since 8 days ago until 7 days ago This query asks, “What was the schema like a week ago?” Since it’s a standard select statement, you can use the standard time range clauses. select keyset() from myTable where hostname is not null This query returns the schema of rows with a hostname column. You can use the standard where clause. select keyset() from Metric where metricName = ‘cpuTime’ This query returns the schema for the given metric name only. This is a handy way to get the tag set for a metric name. select keyset() from Metric facet metricName Facet is the NRQL equivalent of group by. This query returns the schema of many metric names, grouped by metric name. select uniqueCount(metricName) from Metric This query tells you how many unique metric names you have. select uniques(metricName) from Metric where metricName = ‘cpu%’ This query returns all metric names starting with cpu. select uniques(metricName) from Metric where hostname = ‘server1’ This query returns all metric names with a hostname tag of server1. In the next section, we’ll describe the main data types stored in Telemetry Data Platform.  Unified Telemetry: The Key Data Types of Telemetry Data Platform In the age of observability, you need to instrument everything and view all your telemetry data in one place. At New Relic, we believe that metrics, events, logs, and traces (or MELT for short) are the essential data types of observability. When you instrument everything and use MELT to form a fundamental, working knowledge of the relationships and dependencies within your system, as well as its detailed performance and health, you’re practicing observability. But to form those connections, you need a single unified database built on a flexible schema, like that of Telemetry Data Platform. Telemetry Data Platform supports the four main telemetry data types: Metrics: An aggregated set of measurements grouped or collected at regular intervals Events: Discrete occurrences happening at a moment in time in your system Logs: Time-stamped text-based messages, typically arranged as structured data Traces: Known as distributed traces, these are samples of discrete and irregular causal chains of events (or transactions) between different components in a microservices ecosystem For a deeper dive into the core data types, check out MELT 101: An introduction to the four essential telemetry data types. With New Relic, these telemetry data types: Are stored in one place—Telemetry Data Platform—with different data types in different tables. Are unified under one data model—a relational model with a flexible schema. Can all be queried by the same language—NRQL.     NRQL + telemetry data = a unified user experience With Telemetry Data Platform, you get a consistent data model and query language across each telemetry data type. And it’s not just for querying the data—many parts of the platform have NRQL integrated within their APIs. For example, you can define Alert conditions with NRQL, and NRQL is used to create events-to-metrics rules. This power and flexibility makes your day-to-day work much easier. Now, let’s look at how each of these data types are used in Telemetry Data Platform.   Scaling big metrics Metrics are a staple in the world of telemetry. They work well for large bodies of data, or data collected at regular intervals, when you know what you want to ask ahead of time.   Scale matters, and Telemetry Data Platform's scale is hard to beat Telemetry Data Platform’s analysis capabilities shine at scale. Let’s say you work for a big enterprise, with tens of thousands of hosts across multiple data centers, and you want to find out which of your data centers have the heaviest load. You could use the following query: select average(cpuPercent) from Metric facet dataCenter since 7 days ago. Given that your thousands of hosts are spread across multiple data centers, the query needs to aggregate the cpuPercent metric from all the hosts, which requires accessing more than 10,000 time series. In the world of metrics and telemetry data, this is the well-known “high cardinality” problem, where high volumes of unique values in a dataset can outpace a database’s ability to analyze the data. Most time series databases, which are designed to chart only a few time series, struggle to perform these types of queries. But Telemetry Data Platform easily returns results in milliseconds.     Telemetry Data Platform supports the following metric types: Metric Description Available query functions gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. latest min max average sum count count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. sum summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/durations. average min max count sum Pre-aggregating metrics into longer time windows to optimize queries is a common practice, and Telemetry Data Platform takes full advantage of this technique. For example, Telemetry Data Platform produces 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, 6-hour, and 1-day aggregates of metric data. At query time, the query worker chooses the optimal roll-up window for the given time horizon. For example, a year-long query will use 1-day roll-ups, whereas a 12-hour query leverages 1-minute roll-ups.   Getting insight into discrete occurrences with events Events are a critical telemetry data type for observability, providing discrete, detailed records of significant points for analysis. Common examples of events include deployments, transactions, and errors. Monitoring events helps you do fine-grained analysis in real time.  With events in Telemetry Data Platform, you get: Free-form ingestion: In addition to events generated by New Relic APM agents, you can use the events API to insert custom event data into any table with any schema in Telemetry Data Platform. NRQL queries: Because events are stored in Telemetry Data Platform, you have the full power of NRQL to interrogate them. In contrast, many other telemetry systems treat events as second-class citizens, with only support for simple insert and retrieval. The ability to generate metrics from events: The events-to-metrics service aggregates events into metrics to reduce retention requirements and make queries even faster. Simply define a rule to generate metrics from your events, and instead of storing thousands of events per second, one metric record per minute will track your transaction performance.   Custom events Custom events can be used in all sorts of creative ways, and they’re great for tracking high-volume events, such as application transactions. For example, you can insert an event every time a user places an order on your website, recording the user ID, the dollar amount, the number of items bought, and the processing time. Such granular data provides the ability to investigate individual transactions, going beyond the capabilities of aggregated metrics. Because each transaction is a discrete event, you can analyze the distributions of any given attribute, including the correlation between attributes. The only requirement for custom events in Telemetry Data Platform is that each row must have a timestamp. New Relic agent events New Relic agents create events, which you can query to create your own charts. For example, query Transaction events from APM, and PageView events from New Relic Browser to perform deeper analysis than what you could from default charts. Use the query API to write New Relic One applications based on the custom events you send to Telemetry Data Platform. The following examples show how you can run NRQL queries on custom event data tracking orders placed on your website: Query Usage select histogram(orderDollarAmount, 1000) from Order Get a distribution of the order size. select uniqueCount(userId) from Order Find out how many unique users placed orders. select average(processingTime) from Order facet cases(where numItems < 10, where numItems < 50, where numItems < 100) Find out if the number of items purchased have an impact on processing time. (This query analyzes correlation between two fields. You can’t do this with two metrics because the transaction level correlation is lost when the numbers are aggregated into two metrics.) select average(processingTime) from Order timeseries since 7 days ago Find out the average processing time of all orders. (You can get aggregation on fields, just like with metrics. If you had a processingTime metric in the “Metric” table, the query to get this time series from the Metric table would be identical, except that you would be selecting from the Metric table. This showcases the unified query interface for events and metrics.) Slicing and dicing logs Logs, the original telemetry data type, are lines of text a system produces when certain code blocks are executed. Developers rely on logs for troubleshooting their code, databases, caches, load balancers, or older proprietary systems that aren’t friendly to in-process instrumentation. New Relic Logs in Context writes to Telemetry Data Platform’s Log table, from which your log data is accessible via NRQL. Querying logs is no different than querying events—you have the full analytical power of NRQL at your fingers. Similar to dimensional metrics, log lines have tags, and each tag is represented as a column in the Log table. The “message” column itself contains log text. Arbitrary tags can be specified upon log ingestion.

Stitched together, traces form special events called “spans,” which provide the mechanism to track the causal chain. To do so, each service passes correlation identifiers, known as “trace context,” to each other, and this trace context is used to add attributes on the span. New Relic distributed tracing writes to the “Span” table in Telemetry Data Platform, with each row in the table representing a span: Timestamp EventType TraceID SpanID ParentID ServiceID Duration 2/21/2019 15:34:23 Span 2ec68b32 aaa111   Vending Machine 23 2/21/2019 15:34:22 Span 2ec68b32 bbb111 aaa111 Vending Machine Backend 18 2/21/2019 15:34:20 Span 2ec68b32 ccc111 bbb111 Credit Card Company 15 2/21/2019 15:34:19 Span 2ec68b32 ddd111 ccc111 Issuing Bank 3 As you’d expect, you can query span data in Telemetry Data Platform with NRQL. See our documentation for some example queries. NRQL: Your Gateway to Telemetry Data Platform New Relic Query Language (or NRQL, pronounced “Nerkel”) is the query language for interacting with Telemetry Data Platform. It’s an SQL-like language with extensions to make time series queries fast and easy, with a number of clauses and functions you can use to explore your data on your terms. New Relic uses NRQL behind the scenes to build many of the out-of-the-box charts and dashboards present in tools like New Relic APM and New Relic Infrastructure. Users can also use basic or advanced NRQL queries to create charts with the New Relic One chart builder and for custom New Relic One applications. In many cases, writing a query to create a chart is as simple as writing one line, and query auto completion in chart builder makes writing queries even easier. We modeled NRQL after SQL so that users already familiar with SQL will essentially already understand how to use NRQL. NRQL and SQL syntax overlap by almost 95%, with the remaining 5% representing time series syntax. Below are a few notable times series extensions in NRQL, shown with example queries and charts: TIMESERIES: This clause produces data points indexed by timestamp and is available to most queries in NRQL. Here’s an example of graphing the 95th percentile of the duration field over time: SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES SINCE and UNTIL: These clauses specify the time range of the query. You can combine the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to get a specific time window. For example, this query gives you a result for two days ago: SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView SINCE 2 days AGO UNTIL 1 day AGO COMPARE WITH: This clause produces two sets of output—one derived from the SINCE/UNTIL window and one derived from that same window shifted into the past, for comparison purposes. Here’s an example of comparing session count between today and yesterday: SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 2 hours AGO COMPARE WITH 1 day AGO FACET: This clause is NRQL’s version of group by, tuned for time series data. This query gives you the geographic breakdown of your visitors by country, auto sorted by the groups’ page view durations: SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView FACET countryCode   For further reading on NRQL queries, see NRQL User Manual and Secrets of a NRQL Wizard.   How Telemetry Data Platform achieves millisecond performance Every second, Telemetry Data Platform serves thousands of queries for our customers, who need answers stored in multiple terabytes of data. Moving all that data around to search through it doesn't make sense, so instead we take the query to the data. Every query starts at a query router that locates the data in the cluster and sends the original query to hundreds, or even thousands, of workers to scan where the relevant data resides. To balance memory and IO needs in Telemetry Data Platform’s multi-tenant cluster, very large queries are broken up into smaller pieces. Those pieces of the query are sent to other routers that deliver their partial queries to the workers holding the data. Telemetry Data Platform’s in-memory cache provides the fastest results for recently executed queries, or the workers scan the data from disk for queries asked less often. As each worker reads its files to answer the query, the process is reversed. First, the results of each file are merged on a worker. Then, each worker’s result is merged through the routers recursively until the original router has all of the data, returning the completed answer to the user.

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

For information on high availability integration, see the Prometheus High Availability resource. Set up the integration From the Prometheus remote write setup page, complete these steps. Enter a name for the Prometheus server you’re connecting to and your remote_write URL. The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data, and will be the name used to identify which Prometheus server you're connecting to. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. A good place to add this information is under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. We recommend to use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME> bearer_token:<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Alternatively, you could use this configuration: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>&prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME> If you are completing the remote write integration using Kubernetes and Helm, you should instead add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file.

Details: If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts you should use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. You should use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Troubleshooting the integration If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. Common errors and issues: Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error. If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large. This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error. This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following: Run a query on the error message using NRQL then look at the Message field in UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>. Remove the integration To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file and restart the server. When you remove the integration, this stops new data from flowing, but will not purge or remove any historical data.

Learn how NRDB can give you a leg up on your competition. NRDB: The world’s most powerful telemetry database   Don’t just analyze, take action To succeed in business today, you need to systematically operationalize the data that drives your business and use that information to accelerate your development processes and decision-making. With New Relic, you can define what your organization collectively cares about, track those things in a consistent way, and act on what you see in real time. When a new team or service spins up, you can generate a dashboard with data and KPIs that are specific and relevant to that group. Narrow focus or broad overview: Display metrics that matter most to your team and, when something goes wrong, you can save time searching for answers because you’ll have a full picture of the issue.    Ask questions and find answers New Relic gives you both a broad view of your data as well as the ability to drill deep down with increased granularity. You can ask questions, get answers, and continue iterating as you uncover more detail.  Do a broad search to see how many customers you have—or fine-tune your search and see how many customers you have using Chrome version 63 in Germany. Pivot from one focus to the next quickly and easily: Start with a NRQL query, change it, run it, and change it again.  The autocomplete feature shows you what’s available, and guides you while building/structuring your query.   Understand what your data is saying (and share your own story) Data is only as good as the story it tells. With New Relic you can reveal the truth in your data and frame your information using the right context.  Build a data app for a specific team or person, or generate a dashboard and put it up on a tv screen.  Line charts, bar charts, area charts, pie charts, histograms, funnels, and cohorts are just some of our ready-made visualizations.   Extend the reach of your data New Relic dashboards are available for every data source, which means you can stream and track data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure, and Synthetics) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Essential insights for modern business initiatives Optimize your cloud spend Collect and view your AWS billing data in one place, track KPIs for specific apps and services, and easily stay on top of your budget, potential overruns, actual vs. forecasted trends, and more. Establish effective DevOps processes Give everyone a shared understanding of priorities and outcomes which can help guide action during daily stand-ups, foster more effective teaming, and boost the success and pace of your release cycles. Showcase performance improvements over time Compare before-and-after health in one dashboard. For instance, how a refactored app in dev looks next to one currently in prod, or the behavior of certain customer experience metrics during migration. “Whether I want to look at site speed, purchase success rates, or any other metric we’ve deemed important, I can look at a New Relic dashboard that shows me day-by-day or hour-by-hour if performance is improving or degrading. This is hugely helpful. ” Garett Vargas, CTO, CarRentals.com CarRentals.com Case Study “It started with one business dashboard in New Relic that shows transactions for a new product offering. But now we’re getting requests for other custom dashboards that show usage, transactions, button clicks, and other metrics that help stakeholders measure success and track KPIs that are important for the business.” Adam Gelinas, Advisory Software Engineer, Constant Contact Constant Contact Case Study “There’s less friction now that we have New Relic.

      "body": "You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Read on to learn about the New Relic containerized private minion (CPM), a Docker container-based private minion that accepts and executes synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

Back to top icon WHITE PAPER Guide to Mastering New Relic APM A three-stage approach to getting the most from APM Introduction Early Stage Stability Stage Innovation Stage Download PDF Introduction As New Relic APM helps your team instantly detect anomalies, discover root causes, and optimize performance, you’ll find plenty of ways to expand your own skill set within it.  In this guide, you’ll take the lessons learned from our Guide to Getting Started with New Relic APM and build on them through the lens of an APM maturity curve. You'll begin to understand the APM skills, features, and benefits gained when you mature through the Early, Stability, and Innovation stages as you unlock deeper value from each level’s features. In the process, you will level up your abilities through best practices that will allow you to become an APM wizard—and a key asset to your team—whether your architecture is container-based microservices running in the cloud or a monolith deployed in a private data center. APM maturity curve Once you’ve mastered the basics of APM, it’s time to begin focusing your efforts on areas that will be the most impactful for your organization. Unlike solutions that lack depth, breadth, and extensible full-stack visibility (and only provide basic error reporting capabilities), New Relic APM delivers the most comprehensive instrumentation available. The result is deep, curated error and tracing analytics with automatic code-level detail, cloud-local trace processing, and flexible, composable instrumentation solutions that seamlessly work with open standards.    As with most endeavors, it will be a gradual learning process to fully take advantage of the powers of APM. That’s why we’ve arranged the best practices in this guide according to three levels: Early Stage: From transaction overviews to instant snapshots of your app architecture, these are the quick-win areas that you can immediately start to take advantage of while you’re still making your way through APM. Stability Stage: Once you’ve got solid footing, the guidance in this section will help you further strengthen your overall visibility into your application’s performance, and improve your ability to react to any unexpected events.  Innovation Stage: Finally, you can put everything you’ve learned together and really begin to take things to the next level for your organization. By this point, you should feel comfortable enough to begin customizing your experience through instrumentation, dashboards, improved efficiency, and more.  Those more advanced users should feel free to skip around this guide, but those new to the solution will find advantages in gradually ascending this staircase of APM best practices. Early Stage Improve performance with APM transactions The New Relic APM transactions overview page helps you proactively identify transactions that could benefit from fine-tuning or troubleshooting. This page lists the selected app's transaction requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or RPM). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), the transactions page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. The transactions overview page also allows you to easily drill down to get detailed information so you can quickly resolve errors and performance issues. For example:   Sort transactions based on factors such as “most time-consuming,” “slowest average response time,” “Apdex most dissatisfied,” and “highest throughput.” Select transactions to view app performance, historical performance, and transaction traces.  Identify segments with high call counts or time. HOW TO DO IT Get started by viewing your transactions: In New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer (select an app) > Then click the Throughput table's title for your selected app.  In New Relic APM Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions. [If applicable] To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to New Relic Insights, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to an Insights dashboard link that appears below it. “New Relic underpins everything we're trying to do as an organization by providing the insights we need to make the right decisions about our business.” —Barry Sacks, Chief Technology Officer, Phlexglobal Read the customer story > Analyze and troubleshoot application errors The New Relic APM error analytics feature automatically groups errors by their class so you can immediately see where to focus your attention and resolve issues faster. You can also apply filters and use the “Group by” function to help pinpoint underlying problems or patterns according to criteria most important to you. Links in the error analytics UI can be used to share error data through the New Relic Insights dashboards or via your organization's ticketing system to coordinate resources and resolve errors more quickly. Error analytics can help DevOps teams: Assess the health of applications with fine-grained data on error events. Group errors by attributes (for example, error class, error message, host, and transaction name). Drill down into error trace details to diagnose and troubleshoot specific errors. Optimize error reporting and alerting by ignoring certain errors or filtering expected errors. Reduce troubleshooting time and identify trends in application errors using APM Error Profiles.  HOW TO DO IT To get started, navigate to your error analytics page: New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title for your selected app. New Relic APM Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics. “Many tools provide a lot of technical telemetry, but New Relic can connect that with business metrics and costs.” —Mathias Nitzsche VP of Engineering, Delivery Hero Read the customer story > Understand app architecture, connections, and dependencies APM Service Maps give you an instant snapshot of your app architecture, displaying connections and dependencies so you can quickly troubleshoot performance issues between services. APM Service Maps are especially effective for: Closely monitored apps or services (the apps that your New Relic account users are most interested in) Central apps or services (apps with a lot of connections) High-traffic apps or services (apps with highest throughput) Once you have an app node on the map, you can begin to add its connections to the map, including New Relic Browser apps, databases, or external services (for example, third-party APIs). Every node you add is automatically connected to the map, so you can see the shape of your app's architecture emerge. Service Maps also help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. HOW TO DO IT New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer > (select an entity) > Service map. New Relic APM Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > Service maps. “By using New Relic service maps to visualize our entire environment, we were able to trace the problem to the load balancer, which had stopped sending traffic to everything. Without New Relic, I don’t know how long it would have taken us to get to the root of that problem.” —Cody Martinho, Manager of Business Technology, CafePress Read the customer story > Stability Stage Catch issues before they become critical New Relic Alerts give you full-stack alerting across your entire application environment, so you can resolve issues faster and with less noise. And you can also easily set up policies on the metrics you care about most. That means alerting in New Relic enables you to proactively address underlying problems before they reach your end users and turn into a fire drill. Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you’re taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels. New Relic gives you control over every part of creating a robust alerting solution for your applications and architecture, so you can decide what to monitor, how it will be monitored, when incidents are created, and how notifications are sent. With New Relic Alerts, you also get powerful features so teams will receive the alerts they need faster, and achieve lower response time, including:  Baseline alert conditions that are self-adjusting Anomaly detection that automatically detects violations Outlier detection that detects outliers from group behavior HOW TO DO IT Before you get started, brush up on some of the Alerts basics and how they work in New Relic. Then, review best practices around creating an alert policy. To create an alert policy: Go to alerts.newrelic.com  > Alert policies. From the Alert policies index, select New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the Incident preference. Select Create alert policy. Then, create an alert condition. You should have already been prompted after creating the alert policy, but you can also do so from an existing alert policy's page by selecting Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. “We have monitoring alerts that go to a Slack channel when thresholds hit 50% or 60% of resource utilization so that we can scale the environment if needed before problems arise.” —Dave Shanker, Director of Platform Engineering, Kinect Consulting for World Fuel Services Read the customer story > Keep an eye on your most important transactions In New Relic APM, you designate any transaction as a key transaction when you want it to have a custom level of monitoring, or when you want it to have its own alert policy. Making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions - So you can quickly find and examine them. Slow transactions - When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. HOW TO DO IT To create key transactions, you can do one of two things: From the key transaction index:  Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > Key transactions to view the key transactions index. Select Track a key transaction if this is your first key transaction, or else Add more. From a specific transaction page: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm, then select Overview page or the Transactions page. Select a transaction. Below the transaction title, select Track as key transaction. View your key transactions through the key transaction index by following these steps: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > Key transactions. Select a Key transaction from the index. View the selected key transaction's Overview page, including charts and drill-down options. “New Relic gives us the confidence to try new things, safe in the knowledge that it’ll provide that extra pair of eyes to ensure we’re constantly improving our service.” —Wolfram Kerl, Head of Product, smartpatient Read the customer story > Quickly diagnose errors and latencies in distributed systems Distributed tracing lets you trace the path of a single request as it makes its way through complex systems. You can understand the entire chain of events, discover the latency of that complete request, and know which step in the path is creating a bottleneck. New Relic Distributed Tracing gives you the ability to: Filter trace charts by different data points, so you can analyze trace data in many different ways. Mark as anomalous those spans that are slow when compared with typical behavior. See data from across all available services in the same organization via New Relic One's global view of traces from across all your accounts and applications. Traces include AWS Lambda data and New Relic Browser end-user data, if available. And, for even greater visibility, New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your application traces, then provides visualization for the most actionable data so you can investigate and solve issues faster. And it’s all delivered as a fully managed, cloud-native service with unlimited, on-demand scalability. Plus, with the New Relic Traces API, you can collect open source trace data from applications instrumented with Zipkin distributed tracing or other supported open standards such as OpenTelemetry. HOW TO DO IT First, dive deeper into our distributed tracing resources: Learn: Explore the different types of New Relic distributed tracing. Enable: Decide how to set up your distributed tracing. Use: View your traces in the UI after you enable distributed tracing. Next, get started: New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. You'll see a global view of traces from across all available services. The details available may be limited based on the New Relic accounts you have access to. New Relic APM Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an application) > Distributed tracing. “New Relic allows us to set alerts and triggers based on various KPIs so that we can get ahead of problems before they occur and keep this all-important data flowing.” —Alan Fong, Chief Technology Officer, Fleet Complete Read the customer story > Innovation Stage Track real-time performance before, during, and after deployments Software deployments can be risky events when you don’t have complete and instant visibility into the changes they introduce. New Relic deployment markers allow you to see how software performance changes following deployments. This allows you to either relax, knowing everything is working, or get to work fixing issues. A deployment marker indicates that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata—such as the user, revision, or change-log—for added insight. Deployment markers appear as vertical lines, or “markers,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp within New Relic APM. You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of prior deployments, and archive past deployments from your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. On the APM Deployments page, you can also view and drill down into deployment details to quickly see whether the deployment had a positive or negative impact on Apdex, response time, throughput, or errors. HOW TO DO IT There are different options—including using the New Relic REST API v2 and Slack—for tracking deployments, which you should first review. To review deployments in the UI, access: The activity feed of the APM overview, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages APM performance charts as a chart marker The Deployments page for summary performance “By standardizing our APM offering and making a strategic choice for New Relic, we have drastically improved our application monitoring capabilities and are able to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated requirements.” —Steve Sell, Cloud Delivery Manager, KCOM Read customer story > Find bottlenecks in production Identify bottlenecks in your app with New Relic's low-impact production thread profiler, which collects stack traces over a specific duration and then aggregates and displays them in a detailed call tree for fine-grained diagnosis. It’s performance analysis at its easiest. Use the thread profiler in production environments to identify bottlenecks in an application. It periodically (every 100 ms) captures the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, it aggregates the stack traces to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. After the profiler finishes running, the agent reports the profile data. You can then quickly see which path was called the most in the call tree. The call tree automatically appears on the thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The thread profiling tool helps you quickly troubleshoot application issues and can also highlight and capture issues in code that haven’t yet been instrumented. HOW TO DO IT The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to enable it or disable it in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled Note: For those using Java, you can use our real-time Java profiling in production environments to run continuous profiling of your Java code, along with a JVM cluster timeline view, for a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. Read more. When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from the New Relic user interface: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. “We had no way of tracking performance in real time. Nine times out of 10, we’d hear from the contact center that one of our sites had a problem.” —Jon Booth Director, Web and New Media Group, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Read customer story > Custom instrumentation: Capture additional app details to answer specific questions Custom instrumentation allows you to get detail into areas of your code that New Relic’s automatic instrumentation doesn’t capture. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces and distributed traces to help you identify key issues. Custom instrumentation is useful to: Ignore selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Add custom attributes to transactions for faster investigation and troubleshooting. You can also create custom events, custom attributes, and custom metrics to answer specific questions that are relevant to your business context and visualize your custom data in New Relic One dashboards. Whether it’s our support for OpenTelemetry or W3C Trace Context, New Relic wants to empower those teams using open source frameworks and tools by giving them a single place to analyze their data. That’s why the New Relic Metrics and New Relic Traces APIs provide efficient and easy integrations for getting telemetry data into New Relic. HOW TO DO IT Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently. Review your options and the instructions depending on your agent. User-friendly dashboards for faster troubleshooting New Relic One dashboards allow you to combine data from anywhere in the New Relic platform to build flexible, interactive visualizations.  You can easily explore telemetry data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts. This allows you to quickly deduce the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Dashboards, along with the chart builder and the rest of the New Relic One platform, have been designed for users regardless of experience level. Anyone can surface data and tailor the visualization with little effort. New Relic dashboards let you chart all the events and attributes from the New Relic platform: APM, Browser, Infrastructure, Synthetics, Mobile, Logs, and Serverless. You can add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events to better understand their impact on your business and see details about the digital customer experience, such as pageviews, host transactions, and more. Additionally, you can chart your custom data in dashboards so you can query, analyze, visualize, and share it. With New Relic One dashboards, you can also: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the chart builder. Build flexible, high-density dashboards with a consistent UI. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using the Insights API. And for more information, see our documentation on default data collection. To see the events and attributes New Relic collects, use the New Relic data dictionary. HOW TO DO IT Create a new dashboard From the dashboards index: Select the + Create a dashboard button located at the top right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful title (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully, because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. For a full overview, including cloning, deleting, and favoriting a dashboard, head to our docs page on exploring the dashboards index. We hope you’ve found these best practices valuable. Be sure to visit the New Relic Explorers Hub for more tips and best practices. And if you’re using only New Relic APM today, see the potential of our entire New Relic One platform in action.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda offers in-depth performance monitoring for your Lambda functions. Read on to learn how to enable this feature and get started using it. Using this feature may result in AWS charges. For more information, see the Lambda monitoring requirements.​​​ How Lambda monitoring works Before enabling Lambda monitoring, understanding how data flows from your Lambda functions to New Relic may be helpful: Diagram showing how data flows from a Lambda function to New Relic. When our Lambda monitoring is enabled, this is how data moves from your Lambda function to New Relic: The Lambda function is instrumented with our code. CloudWatch collects Lambda log data and sends it to our log-ingestion Lambda. The log-ingestion Lambda sends that data to New Relic. Enable procedure overview If you already have a New Relic account and use Node.js or Python, we recommend you use our automated installer. If you do not use the automated installer, complete these steps to set up monitoring: Install our CLI tool (recommended) Connect AWS and New Relic (required) Enable instrumentation of your Lambda (required) Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic (required) Step 1. Install the newrelic-lambda-cli tool We provide a command line interface (CLI) tool that's used in steps 2 through 4. We recommend the CLI because it simplifies some of the work, but you can also perform those steps manually. If you want to understand what it does before you install it, see the manual procedures that the CLI tool performs in Step 2, Step 3 (option 2), and Step 4. You can also see the CLI documentation on GitHub. If you prefer a manual install, skip to Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic. CLI requirements To use the CLI too, you need: Python 3.3 or higher The AWS CLI You must be a user or admin with an infrastructure manager Add-on role. Your AWS account needs permissions for creating IAM resources (Role and Policy) and Lambda functions. These resources are created using CloudFormation stacks, so you'll need permissions to create those. For more on permissions, including setting custom policies, expand this collapser: AWS permissions details Resource: * Actions: \"cloudformation:CreateChangeSet\", \"cloudformation:CreateStack\", \"cloudformation:DescribeStacks\", \"cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSets\", \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\", \"iam:CreateRole\", \"iam:GetRole\", \"iam:PassRole\", \"lambda:AddPermission\", \"lambda:CreateFunction\", \"lambda:GetFunction\", \"logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter\", \"logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters\", \"logs:PutSubscriptionFilter\" \"s3:GetObject\" \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet\" Resource: \"arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion\" Actions: \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate\" \"serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate\" Be sure that the AWS account you use to execute the CLI has all of these permissions. If your AWS account permissions are restrictive and you're unable to use the CLI, you can optionally use a manually managed custom IAM policy. This policy would require, at minimum, the following permissions: Resource: \"*\" Action: \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\" \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\" \"cloudwatch:GetMetricData\" \"lambda:GetAccountSettings\" \"lambda:ListFunctions\" \"lambda:ListAliases\" \"lambda:ListTags\" \"lambda:ListEventSourceMappings\" These permissions are the minimum required. We recommend granting a managed ReadOnlyAccess policy as described in Connect AWS to infrastructure monitoring. CLI installation To install the CLI tool: Ensure you have the required permissions for both your New Relic and AWS account. From the command line, run: pip install newrelic-lambda-cli You may need to use pip3 in the command above if you have Python 2.7 installed. The CLI requires Python >=3.3. Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic You must complete this step, and steps 3 and 4, to enable our Lambda monitoring. This step connects AWS to New Relic and creates a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function that sends your instrumented data to New Relic. You can either use the CLI tool or do the steps manually. Use CLI tool When you use the CLI, you have one optional step and one required step: Optional: If you're using multiple AWS profiles or multiple regions, you may want to configure the AWS environment variables: AWS environment variable instructions Setting the region To configure your region, use this environment variable to override the default region: export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=MY_REGION # us-west-2, for example The CLI tool also allows passing this per-command using --aws-region. Setting profiles If you have multiple AWS profiles and don't want to use the default, use AWS_PROFILE environment variable to set another profile name. Ensure the profile is properly configured (including the default region). Example: export AWS_PROFILE=MY_PROFILE Run the following command using the CLI tool: newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --linked-account-name YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME \\ --nr-api-key YOUR_NR_API_KEY This command: Connects your AWS account to New Relic. Installs a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda that will send your instrumented data to New Relic. More details: This defaults to U.S. region. If your account is in the EU region, add this argument: --nr-region \"eu\". If you're instrumenting functions in multiple AWS regions, this command must be run for each region using the --aws-region argument. YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME is either a new AWS account you want to link to New Relic, or it's the name of the AWS account that you linked to when setting up the AWS Lambda monitoring integration. YOUR_NR_API_KEY refers to your personal API key (not your REST API key). For more on the API key and other arguments, see our Lambda monitoring GitHub repo. Manual procedures Here are the manual procedures performed by the CLI tool: Connect AWS to New Relic The newrelic-lambda integration command connects the AWS account containing your Lambdas to New Relic. If you've already installed one of our AWS integrations, your accounts should be linked to New Relic and you can skip this section. To manually establish this connection, follow the instructions for connecting AWS to Infrastructure monitoring. Configure our log-ingestion Lambda The newrelic-lambda integration command sets up a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. This Lambda takes the logs generated by your Lambda functions and pushes those logs to New Relic. If you're configuring this manually, you must configure our Lambda for the regions you want. The CLI, by default, establishes our Lambda in all regions. To manually configure our Lambda, go to the AWS Serverless Application Repository, which is where the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda is stored. This repo is a collection of serverless applications published by developers, companies, and partners in the serverless community. It allows developers to share their Lambda functions code with customers, who can then find and deploy the corresponding application Lambda function. Each application is packaged with an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template that defines the AWS resources used. To manually configure our Lambda with the AWS Serverless Application Repository: From the AWS console, go to the Lambda section, select Create function, and select Serverless Application Repository. Search for newrelic and find the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. Follow the instructions in the Lambda's documentation to deploy it. A SAM template will build the Lambda. In the environment variable section in AWS console, set the LICENSE_KEY environment variable to your New Relic license key. Note: If you have multiple accounts or a master and sub-account hierarchy, make sure the license key you're using matches the same account connected to AWS. Optional: If you want to stream all your logs to New Relic, set the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable to true. For more on this, see Stream all logs. Step 3. Enable Lambda instrumentation This step enables instrumentation of your Lambda function, which allows detailed monitoring and alerting functionality. Our instrumentation is designed to have minimal impact on your Lambda performance. If you're using Node.js or Python, we recommend the first two options. Option #1: Use Serverless Framework plugin (Node.js and Python) Requirements Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. Serverless Framework version 1.34.0 or higher. Features If you meet the requirements (above), you can use our Serverless Framework plugin, which allows you to add our AWS Lambda Layer to your functions without requiring a code change. Supports Node.js and Python runtimes No code change required to enable Lambda instrumentation Enables our APM agent functionality using a single layer Configures CloudWatch subscription filters automatically Gets the layer into your code base which is useful for redeploys Install To install our Serverless Framework plugin: Choose an install option: NPM: npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers yarn: yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Add the plugin to your serverless.yml: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Get your account ID and put it in the serverless.yml: custom: newRelic: accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Deploy it: sls deploy You can skip Step 4. Setting up CloudWatch Logs. This is automatically completed on deploy by our Serverless Framework plugin. For the next step, go to What's next? Option #2: Add Lambda Layer with our CLI (Node.js and Python) Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. If you don’t have Serverless Framework and don't intend to redeploy your function frequently, you can use the CLI to add our Lambda Layer: If you haven't already done so, install the CLI: pip install newrelic-lambda-cli List available functions: newrelic-lambda functions list Pass the option -f not-installed to see which functions have not yet been instrumented. Add the layer to your function: newrelic-lambda layers install --function FUNCTION_NAME --nr-account-id NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID Next, you will configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic. Option #3: Manually add our Lambda Layer (Node.js and Python) Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. If you don’t have Serverless Framework, you can manually add our Lambda Layer: Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your functions handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. If you have Node 8 and get a Lambda can't find file error message, expand this collapser: Node 8 \"can't find file\" error troubleshooting If you have Node 8 and receive a Lambda can't find the file newrelic-lambda-wrapper.js message, it's likely that the Node runtime isn't resolving NPM_PATH for the newrelic-lambda module in /opt/nodejs/node_modules. These steps should fix this problem: Create a newrelic-wrapper-helper.js script in your project's root. The script's contents should be module.exports = require('newrelic-lambda-wrapper');. (That is all that needs to be in that script.) Update the handler for your layer declaration to newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler. Next, you will configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic. Option #4: Manually instrument Lambda code for Go, Java, .NET Core, Node.js, and Python If none of the previous options work for you, you can manually instrument your Lambda code. Choose your language: Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda. Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of the Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException. Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public override Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // This call will block by calling task.Result Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); <Other module loads go under the two require statements above> module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Step 4. Configure CloudWatch logs to stream to New Relic Lambda In this step, you'll link your Lambda function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda that was configured in Step 2. For Node.js and Python: This step isn't necessary if you used the Serverless Framework plugin option in Step 3. This step can be done using the CLI tool or using manual procedures. Use CLI tool Run this command for every Lambda function you want to monitor: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function FUNCTION_NAME_#1 Or to set subscription filters for all supported functions run this command:: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function all Notes on this command: You should only need one newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda per AWS account and region. You can subscribe as many functions to it as you like. To see more detail about the arguments, including a region-specifying argument, see our GitHub documentation. You may receive a CloudWatch validation error. This doesn't affect data reporting. If you see data reporting in New Relic, disregard that error message. If you have our Logs and want to send all your log data to us (not just Lambda logs), see Stream all logs. Manual procedures Here are the manual procedures performed by the CLI tool: Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda In Step 2, you set up a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function. After you've instrumented your Lambda function (Step 3), the newrelic-lambda subscriptions command links that function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. To do this manually: Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\". Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting. Use configuration settings to fine-tune your data. Our newrelic-log-ingestion function is not updated automatically. For best results and access to latest features, we recommend you occasionally update our Lambda monitoring. Optional: Stream all logs to New Relic If you have log management enabled and want to report all your logs to New Relic, follow these instructions: Go to our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda and set the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable to true. It isn't possible to edit existing filter patterns, so they must be removed and re-added: Set the Subscription filter pattern to \"\". Go to the Log group for each monitored Lambda, and remove the newrelic-log-ingestion subscription. Add the subscription filter back, leaving the Subscription filter pattern field blank.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

Back to top icon White Paper Modernizing with AWS: Replatforming Part 2 of our 3-part series on application modernization in the cloud Introduction What Is Replatforming and What Are the Benefits? What Are the Risks and How Can You Minimize Them? Compatibility Analysis Using an “Informed Replatforming” Approach Use Data Before, During, and After Your Project AWS Well-Architected Framework: Performance Efficiency AWS Well-Architected Framework: Cost Optimization AWS Well-Architected Framework: Reliability AWS Well-Architected Framework: Operational Excellence AWS Well-Architected Framework: Security Next Steps Links Download PDF Introduction Fundamentally, organizations modernize existing applications by moving them to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to optimize everything from performance to reliability to customer experience. For the business, the goals and measurable outcomes are typically some combination of the following:  Improve the customer experience with better reliability and performance  Reduce operational cost and effort  Accelerate time-to-market for new features  Develop and enhance technical and business agility    While modernizing existing applications can take several different forms, this white paper focuses on the replatforming approach, also known as component modernization. (For an introduction to the six approaches to application modernization on AWS (retire, repurchase, retain, rehost, replatform, and refactor), read our new ebook The Enterprise Guide to Continuous Application Modernization.)   While rehosting involves moving an existing application to AWS without changes to the business logic, replatforming requires something more; namely, optimizing the application by modernizing one or more components of the application. Components are essentially an endpoint, something that the application interacts with via a standardized API, such as a web server, relational database, or messaging system. Somewhat riskier than rehosting, yet less complex than refactoring, replatforming can be categorized as a modernization “middle road” when it comes to risk and complexity because modernizing components usually involves some level of changes to the code. Nonetheless, how do you know when the replatforming approach is the right decision? Which applications are best suited for this approach? And, more important, how can you further reduce project risk while streamlining the effort and maximizing all the benefits of a replatformed application on AWS?  Here’s a hint: data and best practices. This white paper presents the knowledge and experience of New Relic working closely with AWS and discusses how you can make informed decisions to optimize your efforts and outcomes.        What Is Replatforming and What Are the Benefits? While rehosting is a lift-and-shift approach with no code changes whatsoever (moving your application essentially as-is to AWS) replatforming takes this approach a little further. Based on observations about the application, you make an informed decision to change one or more components of the application, and in doing so, achieve additional optimizations.    To be clear, changing a component does not change the business logic. It does, however, require changes to configuration, set up, tear down, and administrative practices. For instance, coding for a data connection or an API could change, but the change doesn’t impact the business logic of the application. Any component change you make as part of a replatforming project should follow this rule. On the other hand, changing an application from using a relational database to an object store requires business logic changes, which makes it a refactoring project, not a replatforming one, because it fundamentally changes how your application behaves. Let’s review a few examples of replatforming on AWS:  Changing to a managed relational database service such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) or moving to a metered database such as Amazon Aurora Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your application Moving from self-managed Apache Kafka (on-premise, AWS, or some other SaaS Kafka) to Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) Leveraging AWS Certificate Manager instead of running your own certificate infrastructure Moving from a self-managed Kubernetes environment to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) What these examples have in common is that the code is interacting with components through a fairly standardized API. While the API will likely need to be tweaked, the business logic should not be impacted.  Why undertake a replatforming project? The benefits will depend on which component you’re changing, but they can and should include outcomes such as:  Improved scalability to accommodate business growth Improved reliability and performance for a better customer experience  Reduced costs for software licensing and resource usage  Reduction of the total security surface area of your application Reduction in management efforts and associated time and costs Improved ability to make informed decisions What Are the Risks and How Can You Minimize Them? In any project, understanding the risks involved is the first step in minimizing them. While the risks for this type of modernization are relatively low, there are certain ones you may encounter when you replatform applications. These can include:      Failure to understand application dependencies and/or overly aggressive and complex project goals  Lack of cost savings due to automation not being implemented or improved during the replatforming change (manual efforts are still required to operate the application)  Negative impact on the customer experience due to poor performance or availability caused by unexpected errors Project time exceeds original plans because of unexpected errors and/or dependencies  Failure to identify application incompatibility with the new platform. These risks and others can be avoided or minimized by using best practices that are informed and guided by data derived before, during, and after the replatforming project. Compatibility Analysis It’s critical that you carefully evaluate your existing application, its structure, and business requirements to determine compatibility with the new target platform. Considerations could include factors such as: New database service not supporting same requirements as the previous one Application not being compatible with the available operating systems on the new platform (in this case you may need to think about using a container replatform strategy) New platform not meeting security requirements of application or business (HIPAA, FedRAMP, GDPR, etc.) Ensure you identify and establish compatibility for all relevant application factors that relate to your application and its business requirements. Incompatibilities may indicate that the application is a candidate for refactoring rather than replatforming. Using an “Informed Replatforming” Approach Successful modernization projects require deep visibility into your applications, customer experiences, and business outcomes. This means having comprehensive data at your fingertips so that you can make informed decisions about which applications to replatform and which candidate components to change. Data is also essential to help you reduce overall project risk, streamline the project, and measure and prove success.  To take an “informed replatforming” approach, as we call it at New Relic, you need to begin gathering data about the applications you are considering replatforming prior to taking any action. You will continue to track data during and after the project. In general, you should gather data about:  End-user experience Application performance  Application dependencies  Application issues Resource usage Existing components  To identify candidates, you will review application endpoints, their versions, and their performance impact on the application. You’re looking for applications with clear APIs to specific functionality that is “black boxed.” The connections that depend on the component are critical to your success; It’s important to identify them all by finding the dependencies using New Relic.  A great place to start is with a service map of your application. New Relic service maps are visual, customizable representations of your architecture showing connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. With data in hand, you can then begin working through the steps of an informed replatforming project:  Identify candidates using service maps, end-user experiences, and application performance data. Analyze the application for known issues. Install the component on host integrations to get deeper visibility into component performance. Choose a limited set of components to change.   Apply AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices.  Deploy, test, and transition using automation. Gain a Deep Understanding of Your Components Develop a deeper understanding of existing componentry using New Relic host integrations on AWS, which let you filter, analyze, and query data about your AWS services. For a complete list of AWS integrations and to learn more, visit our documentation page.   Use Data Before, During, and After Your Project Data is not only imperative for the decision making and planning of your project, it’s also the best way to gain the confidence and insight to successfully change components in your applications. That’s because maintaining visibility into the application, infrastructure, componentry, end-user experience, and business success throughout the project gives you multiple advantages. With the right data, you can accelerate your efforts without increasing risk, anticipate and avoid problems, minimize complexity, and maximize optimization of the application in the AWS environment.    Here’s how to use data at each phase of the replatforming project:   BEFORE: Begin monitoring candidate applications in your current environment with New Relic to understand application performance, end-user experiences, resource consumption, error rates, application uptime, and other critical KPIs. These measurements will serve as baseline metrics for comparison during and after the replatforming. This data also allows you to create a plan for addressing systemic application issues that you’ve identified. Use the information you gather to understand the existing profile of the component you are looking to replatform and its current issues. Then prioritize the candidates based on the potential positive impact on business goals. DURING: As you begin the replatforming project, it’s important to test your applications to make sure the transition isn’t introducing any problems or slowdowns. During replatforming, use New Relic to check the performance of application code and external services and compare it against the pre-replatforming baselines you established in the “before” phase. This will give you an apples-to-apples comparison. AFTER: Once the replatforming is complete, use New Relic to prove and measure your success and identify opportunities to further optimize applications for performance gains, efficient use of resources, and ease of operation. One way to measure and track replatforming success is by using New Relic combined with the best practices in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The Well-Architected Framework consists of five pillars: performance efficiency, cost optimization, reliability, operational excellence, and security. The framework was developed to help companies build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Don’t Underestimate the Importance of Infrastructure-as-Code  A strong infrastructure-as-code DevOps practice allows you to experiment quickly. That’s because the ability to quickly set up and tear down environments in isolation lets you rapidly determine whether you will see a benefit in moving to a new component or service. Read about AWS CloudFormation to learn more about codifying your infrastructure. AWS Well-Architected Framework: Performance Efficiency A best practice around the first pillar of the Well-Architected Framework is to monitor and measure the efficiency of resource usage before, during, and after your replatforming project. You can use New Relic to review how resource usage has changed. How much efficiency have you gained?    While your replatforming project may not be triggered by performance improvements, you still need to understand the impact on your end users. Are you making things better? Did the change have any impact on the outcomes being driven by the application, such as more click throughs or conversions because pages load more quickly? Gaining visibility into this information is critical to assess the impact of your efforts on revenue-generating systems. AWS Well-Architected Framework: Cost Optimization Apdex is an industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services, which helps you see how satisfied users are with your application. Use New Relic to compare your Apdex to the costs incurred by the application. Is this an appropriate level of investment for the role the application plays? What should your targets be for the end-user experience? Your goal is to balance these with the costs, meeting your end-user experience objectives without breaking the bank. Keep in mind that cost optimization as part of a replatforming exercise is about more than just license fees. It is also related to the amount of labor cost required to self-manage a component as well as the costs of any production issues or outages related to that component. Therefore, the costs to consider should include:  The number of components (including component versions) that are being managed License cost Infrastructure cost (focusing on the balance between performance, reliability, and scalability) Operational cost Impact on the security footprint Error management and reduction of rework and issues related to the component AWS Well-Architected Framework: Reliability Today’s digital businesses have stringent uptime requirements for critical applications. Start with a clear understanding of your service-level agreement (SLA) and uptime requirements. Then compare reliability metrics to see how the application is performing against the SLA. What is your rate of application uptime? How often are your users impacted by errors?  Also consider that your application needs to scale and be reliable for your company’s busiest day, including expected and unexpected spikes. You need both scalability and reliability, working in concert, to achieve your SLA goals and keep your customers happy.  To that end, how well is your scaling performing? For most applications, scaling requirements are difficult to anticipate, even when only predicting six months into the future. With a small number of users, you don’t need to worry much about how well the application scales, but at higher numbers, scaling must happen automatically. You shouldn’t be spending time tuning your autoscaling rules. Based on the number of users, are you using the right technologies? How ready are you for an increase or decrease in usage?  You can get in-depth scaling information on your components using New Relic host integrations. Look at metrics such as refused connections, queue lengths, and shards relocating—all of which are indicators of an undersized system. On the other hand, the component may be overprovisioned, using too many resources to accommodate the peaks, but wasteful during the valleys. When you take advantage of an AWS managed service, much of this work is handled for you behind the scenes. Keep in mind that this pillar of the Well-Architected Framework isn’t just about measuring your current reliability, but assessing whether you’re using the right technologies to be scalable and reliable tomorrow. Compare your current user base and expected user base to how much of your application is using seamlessly scalable technologies. While not every application will be entirely serverless, with the right data you can make better choices about what you are managing yourself. Scale Up From a Few Users to 10 Million  View this presentation from AWS re:Invent 2018 to learn about how to make your applications more scalable, including moving to serverless technologies where scaling is handled for you automatically.   AWS Well-Architected Framework: Operational Excellence As you go through the replatforming exercise, you should be looking for ways to increase the amount of automation. For instance, adopting managed services can free up developer time and make it easier for developers to experiment because they can easily spin up a new environment to try out a new idea. Over time, how is development improving? How much more quickly can you deliver features? You should see that you have more time to spend on the tasks that will make a real difference to the business. If you have code sprawl in relation to a particular component, you should identify all the areas that need to change. Then start monitoring things like: Number of lines of code How well data is componentized Issues related to data in production How quickly you can provision an environment As you componentize the data access layer, you reduce the number of lines of code you need to maintain. Less code means fewer errors, typically more rigorously tested code, and fewer areas that could be potential security risks. To achieve this, you’ll need to start leveraging strong DevOps practices.  Deploying self-managed components such as Apache Kafka will not usually be as easily scriptable as using a CloudFormation template on AWS. Streamlining deployment and maintenance processes for a component  results in fewer moving parts that you have to manage. AWS Well-Architected Framework: Security For security, an important metric to understand is how much your organization is reducing the security surface area and effort by using managed services. How many databases do you no longer need to track, manage, and patch from a security perspective? And in addition to the number of databases, how many types of databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server) and how many different versions (1.2, 2.7, 5.4.2, etc.)? The more database types and versions you need to secure, the more your security challenge increases. For instance, with Amazon Aurora, many security tasks are handled for you, allowing you to focus on other areas. You still need to provide proper rules to protect the data and control who has access, but the lower-level security concerns, such as operating system patches and updates, are managed by AWS. Because cybersecurity is both a technical and a legal issue, it’s important to understand your organization’s security and governance requirements and how they map to what is contractually provided by AWS. Next Steps Application modernization is an iterative process—you’re never really finished. You should be continuously looking across your applications for additional components that could benefit from replatforming. And remember that replatforming isn’t necessarily the next step in modernizing an application. Sometimes the best next step will be to refactor the application (make code-level changes to take advantage of modern cloud services, architectures, and technologies) to achieve new levels of quality, performance, scalability, reliability, and flexibility. Regardless of where you are in your modernization efforts, New Relic can help you optimize your applications faster, more cost-effectively, and with less risk. As an AWS Advanced Technology Partner, New Relic has been granted AWS Competency in five solution areas (Migration, DevOps, Mobile, Government, and Marketplace) based on our technical proficiency and proven customer success.    Get more from your AWS investment With observability for every stage of your modernization journey, you can unlock the full benefits of the cloud.
