Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Frequently Asked Questions What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? What is NRQL? Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? What database does New Relic use? What Events are collected in New Relic? Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Can I add external data to New Relic? Can I extract data from New Relic? How much does New Relic cost? What is the data retention period for events I can query? What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? New Relic provides a real-time analytics platform that collects metrics, events, logs, and traces directly from your live production software, infrastructure, and services, transforming them into actionable insights about your entire stack, your business, and your customers' experiences. What is NRQL? NRQL, New Relic Query Language, is a SQL-like query language used to query the New Relic Database. Read more on how to get started using NRQL. Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? SQL knowledge will help in getting started with using New Relic like a pro, but it is not a required skill. New Relic comes equipped with built-in tutorials to get you up to speed quickly with its capabilities, pre-built example queries to experiment with, a point-and-click Chart Builder for querying your data, as well as an autocomplete feature to help guide the way when writing your own queries. What database does New Relic use? New Relic is powered by New Relic Database, a highly-distributed cloud-hosted time series database with an innovative architecture that does not require indexing. The database runs on a super-cluster built to support our thousands of customers - enabling you to query your big data in milliseconds. Learn more about New Relic Database. What Events are collected in New Relic? Out of the box, New Relic collects data on three event types from your web and mobile applications. For web applications, New Relic automatically collects PageViews events, which are instrumented by New Relic's Browser agent and Transaction events, which are instrumented by New Relic APM agents (.NET, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.js). For native mobile applications, New Relic automatically collects MobileSession events directly from your native mobile applications using the New Relic Mobile APM SDKs (iOS and Android). By default, New Relic Synthetics populates a set of default attributes. Query SyntheticCheck to return metrics from one run of a particular monitor, while SyntheticRequest attributes return results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Yes, New Relic has designed adding custom attributes to be a simple process. It typically requires no more than one additional line of code to your app per attribute. Decorating your PageView and Transaction events with custom attributes is a powerful way to collect events from your software that are not collected out of the box. MobileSession Events do not currently support adding custom attributes. Learn more about how to add custom attributes and what kind of data you can add. Can I add external data to New Relic? Yes, New Relic is an open platform, allowing you to send metric, event, log, and trace data from 3rd party instrumentation sources. For example, use custom events to store data in New Relic that is not available during a page view, server transaction or mobile session event. Learn more about how New Relic supports open instrumentation to ingest metrics data from Prometheus, tracing data instrumented with Zipkin, or logs data from Fluentd. Can I extract data from New Relic? Exporting data from New Relic is available via New Relic's API or via JSON code provided with each chart, graph and dashboard. Find out more about exporting New Relic data.  How much does New Relic cost? New Relic's subscription pricing is based on the number of metrics, events, logs, and traces stored in New Relic Database. Customers should reach out to an account executive to determine pricing. What is the data retention period for events I can query? Data retention varies based on the type of data stored (metrics, events, logs, and traces), and is generally up to you. New Relic has customizable data retention settings, so in some cases you can keep data in New Relic for as long as you want. Prices are determined by the amount of data that you store, so you will want to choose a retention period (where applicable) that meets your business and budgetary needs. Free access to New Relic. Forever. Monitor your stack for free with full platform access and 100GB of ingest per month. No credit card required.

Distributed tracing Distributed tracing plays a very important role in the troubleshooting experience since it lets you dig into the communication pipe between the AWS Lambda function and any other artifact that function talks to during its execution. Distributed tracing also gives you valuable information regarding what each transaction is about, the time it takes to complete, and if there were errors. Inventoried Tags and Metadata We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Facet Builder New Relic’s Facet Builder for AWS Lambda instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom insights—without having to write queries. Metrics, events, and other measurement High cardinality invocation data View throughput, detailed categorized AWS Lambda performance metrics like duration, cold starts, error rate and more at any transaction percentile. Filter and facet by tags and function metadata to rapidly find the answer you’re looking for. AWS CloudWatch Metrics We capture metrics harvested from AWS CloudWatch for over 30 connected AWS services including AWS Lambda, allowing you to understand the performance of event-driven architectures that include queues and data streams. Key event AWS Lambda metrics like iterator age, dead letter errors / dead letter queue depth, and throttles can be visualized along performance data from instrumentation in your functions. Custom attributes and custom events Capture and send custom attributes or events and tag their function invocations with attributes, so you can connect your performance data to specific business KPIs, or understand the performance of specific functionality within your function. Errors and alerts Rich error analysis View all the errors that occurred in your function code and analyze all the details and error traces. Use agent APIs to define custom errors, even when your function runs as expected. Rich alert ecosystem Build alerts using NRQL, allowing you to drive alerts based on custom attributes or any function-specific attribute.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "To set up deployment notifications for apps monitored by New Relic APM, use webhooks, APM agent-specific options, or New Relic's REST API.",
      "body": "Deployments of applications can be risky events. New Relic allows you to correlate those events to the performance of your applications, using deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Several options are available to manage your deployment data. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Notify your team of deployments Owners and Admins After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. Using a Personal API key with the REST API To use a Personal API key in any of the examples below, replace 'X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY' with 'Api-Key','YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY'. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'X-Api-Key'='YOUR_API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('X-Api-Key','YOUR_API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your REST API key or Personal API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -i Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your Admin User's API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:ADMIN_USERS_KEY\" \\ -i Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.

You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded alert status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter by tag or entity name There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities: Filter entities by tags: Use Filter with tags at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with production, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see Tagging. Filter by entity name: Use Search services by name at the top of the page. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

Back to top icon Article Tips and Tricks for Monitoring AWS with New Relic Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications. Links Download PDF Whether you’re a seasoned New Relic user or are just starting to understand how the New Relic platform works, there’s always a new tip or trick you can use to improve the performance of your cloud-hosted applications. Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications: 1. Right-size your AWS instances The transient nature of EC2 instances can make it difficult to get an accurate view of your AWS ecosystem. Your company may have many different individuals or groups who are spinning up EC2 instances for various purposes. Because of this, a complete view of the current state of your AWS environment is essential. A decommissioned host is not a “dead” server; rather, it has merely served its purpose. Using New Relic Infrastructure, you instantly get an accurate snapshot of your EC2 instances, which allows you to then dissect them by the AWS tags you already use. Ultimately, this 360-degree view of your infrastructure allows you to optimize (or right-size) your AWS instances for maximum ROI. 2. Monitor all the (AWS) things While EC2 powers most AWS workloads, it’s by no means the only AWS service used to power modern applications. To fully understand how your AWS ecosystem is performing, you need to monitor the other services you use. New Relic Infrastructure Professional allows you to monitor the performance health of many popular AWS services, such as CloudFront, DynamoDB, EBS, ElastiCache, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), IAM, Kinesis, RDS, SNS, SQS, and VPC, to name just a few of the services New Relic can monitor. To use these services effectively, you need context. For example, AWS ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, which you don’t always have visibility into. But by tracking ELB requests per second as well as write and read volume in New Relic Insights, you can understand exactly how that load is being balanced to make sure you’re using the service as effectively as possible. 3. Set up auto-scaling alerts and dashboards Ops teams depend on critical alerts and custom dashboards to tell the whole story about infrastructure performance. That’s why New Relic makes it easy for you to set thresholds for alerts on various metrics relating to your applications, servers, and key transactions. As EC2 instances come and go, your alerts and dashboards need to auto-scale with them. You can manage alerts by creating specified user groups and by leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels, including OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Slack, VictorOps, and Campfire. If you’re using a different alerting solution, use our Webhook feature to send a JSON Object anywhere you choose. New Relic also gives you the option to create customized dashboards for a curated view of what you care about most when running your applications in an AWS ecosystem. 4. Automate your setup When you’re operating in a dynamic AWS environment, your underlying infrastructure is constantly shifting. While AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning the resources, it raises the obvious question of how your application software is deployed, configured, and executed on your Amazon EC2 instances. That’s why you should consider using an automation solution like Chef or Puppet, which can automatically configure your systems and apps that sit on top of your infrastructure. Both tools make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. When these config management tools are combined with New Relic Infrastructure, you get an instant view of your EC2 metrics, as well as the change events associated with their configuration. 5. Keep an eye on the entire stack The great thing about using New Relic to monitor your AWS applications is that it doesn’t just give you visibility into a certain portion of your application stack, but lets you see the entire thing—even if you’re running in a hybrid cloud, on-premise, or both. If you spot a performance problem in New Relic APM, for example, you can easily correlate to issues with your infrastructure using New Relic Infrastructure. You can test your application from outside the firewall using New Relic Synthetics, see what’s going on at the interaction level using New Relic Browser, and also organize, query, and visualize all this data using New Relic Insights to answer key questions about application and customer experience—all in real time. Performance monitoring for AWS Build, migrate, and deploy your applications and infrastructure faster with AWS monitoring from New Relic.

From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, Browser, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance.

      "body": "New Relic One now has a UI dedicated to providing full APM functionality for your OpenTelemetry data. With this curated experience, you can find the root cause of incidents quickly, and optimize the performance of your applications and services. Send your OpenTelemetry data to New Relic using one of the OpenTelemetry exporters and quickly discover and analyze your data using one of these key pages: Entity Explorer: The entity explorer gives you a unified view of every entity so you can see everything you monitor in one place and quickly zoom into what you care about most. Summary page: The summary page provides an overview of “golden signals” for a service or application, such as response time, throughput, and error rate. Transactions page: Use the APM transactions page to identify transactions that might be causing the problem. Distributed Tracing: With distributed tracing, you can get an end-to-end view of a single request across your services and quickly identify slow and error traces. Externals: The external services page captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Databases: The databases page shows an application’s database and cache data with charts to view throughput, response time and operations. Metric explorer: Use the metrics explorer to view your metrics and facet by various dimensions and create dashboards.",

Ingest alerts, incidents and event data from any source, and you'll start seeing the benefits of anomaly detection and automatic noise reduction right away. Automatic anomaly detection Get notified about potential problems in your tools of choice before they turn into incidents. Applied Intelligence proactively monitors your services for anomalies based on SRE golden signals—such as latency, errors, and traffic—and notifies you with real-time failure warnings and actionable details so you can investigate faster. See all anomalies in one place with access to deeper analysis Visualize and troubleshoot all anomalies across your environment from a single page, with the ability to instantly view critical details for each one. Anomaly analysis includes key attributes that caused spikes, related signals to investigate root cause by looking at what happened around the anomaly, and visibility into upstream and downstream dependencies. Correlate incidents to reduce alert noise and fatigue Automatically group and prioritize your alerts and incident data to decrease noise and focus on what matters most. Applied Intelligence establishes relationships between incidents and includes flapping detection and smart suppression to reduce noise from low-priority alerts by as much as 90 percent. Correlate incidents with your own decision logic Build and gauge the impact of your own correlation logic with an intuitive decision builder that makes it simple to tell New Relic AI what data to compare and correlate, then previews its potential impact. You can create logic based on any event attribute, adjust frequency and duration thresholds, and even choose out-of-the-box similarity algorithms, so you get full flexibility and control. Get transparency into why incidents are correlated AIOps tools shouldn’t be a black box. Applied Intelligence provides full transparency into why and how issues are correlated, so you have confidence in the ML models that reduce noise while ensuring that critical signals don’t go unnoticed. Diagnose and respond faster with incident intelligence Applied Intelligence enriches correlated incidents with deeper context and metadata, so you can understand the issue and take action to resolve it. Alerts are automatically classified based on golden signals and related components of your environments are identified, so you can quickly determine the probable cause and isolate the source of the problem. Escalate incidents to the right responders faster Route correlated incidents to the team members best equipped to respond and make noisy, misdirected alerts a thing of the past. Applied Intelligence suggests responders based on your data, and gives you the flexibility to easily determine where and how you send issues to your teams.   No changes to your existing incident response workflow Connect your incident management tools as destinations quickly and easily. Applied Intelligence delivers correlated, enriched incidents into tools like PagerDuty, OpsGenie, ServiceNow, and more, so you don’t need to reinvent your on-call workflow.   Experience Applied Intelligence Applied Intelligence delivers guidance and analysis that makes it faster and easier than ever to detect, understand and resolve incidents.

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "info": "Add a table to your New Relic One app.",
      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query personal API keys (user keys) in similar ways, replacing the ingest-specific fields with fields specific to the API. To understand the structure of these objects, you can experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete personal API keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a personal API key: Create a personal API key To create a personal API key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "New Relic provides an events-to-metrics service that lets you generate metric-type data from your event-type data. Metrics are aggregates of your event data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from event data? Historically for New Relic, NRQL queries and the resulting charts were created only with event-type data. With the new events-to-metrics feature, you can create metrics from your event data and create queries and charts from those metrics. Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage, which in turn allows for faster, more efficient data queries and chart-builds. Here's an explanation of these two types of data: Events: Event data represents a record of a single event at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your event data. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you could aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this month-over-month. For more on how metrics and events are different, see Understand data types. Note that creating metrics from events will not delete events; this feature creates metrics from the event data without altering the events. More details on what makes metrics unique and better for longer-range querying/charting: Metrics are dimensional; you get to choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated Data retention is 13 months. Metrics are queryable using the Metric event type. Start creating an events-to-metrics rule. Available operations To perform events-to-metrics operations, you'll use NerdGraph, which is our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. The events-to-metrics feature’s operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new events-to-metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing events-to-metrics rules). All metrics-to-events operations are role-based. When performed via NerdGraph, they'll be made under the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations include: Create an events-to-metrics rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Here's an example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Let's look at some elements of this request: mutation: one of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule: The method being called to delete a rule. deletes takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the events-to-metrics rule. accountId: The New Relic account ID. In the successes and submitted blocks, you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (ruleId for submitted), name, description, nrql, enabled, and accountId. Here's an example response for the above example request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Enable/disable a rule This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To disable or enable an existing events-to-metrics rule, you use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation, with the only difference being whether enabled is set to true or false Here's an example request for enabling an existing events-to-metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Let's go through some elements of this request: mutation: one of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule: The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the events-to-metrics rule. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. In the successes and submitted blocks, you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can choose to list all rules in a New Relic account, or return a specific rule. Below is an example of listing of all rules for an account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Let's go through some elements of this request: query: one of the basic API operation types, used for querying but not making changes. actor: This specifies the current user. account(id: 123456): Specify the ID for the New Relic account to retrieve data from. eventsToMetrics: Scope the data to only events-to-metrics rules. allRules: Returns all rules for that account. rules: In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Here's an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now want to list its contents to review it. Below is an example listing rule number 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } For more detail about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Here's an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure, and to build and run the events-to-metrics operations. To use this tool: Once you have an operation's request created with the required parameters, go to the GraphiQL API tool and paste your query into the box on the left. Execute the operation by pressing Play. (Optionally, you can get the cURL format by selecting Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box on the right side. If you'd like to verify a rule-creation operation was performed successfully, you can run a list query for that rule ID.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "info": "Build a New Relic app showing page view data on a world map.",
      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "info": "How to configure control plane monitoring for your Kubernetes integration with New Relic.",
      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert.

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn about how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see Event data retention.

This document describes our APIs, the keys required to execute certain functions, and how to manage access to these API keys. Where to use our API keys Different APIs use different types of API keys. When using... ... use this key NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most data that New Relic collects and to do some management tasks Personal API key Our APIs for event, log, metric, or trace data. Insert API key Our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, or Mobile REST APIs; and the API Explorer. REST API key (or Personal API key) Admin-only functionality with the REST API and API Explorer; or with the Synthetics API. Admin’s API key (or Personal API key) One of New Relic's query APIs to query data. Query API key Personal API key If you are a user on our New Relic One user model, including accounts on our newer pricing plan, you cannot manage this API key from the UI. Instead, use NerdGraph or the NerdGraph API explorer. Learn more. This API key allows you to use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and the REST API. You can use NerdGraph to query entities, see relationships between them, add tags to entities, and more. Personal API keys are generated on a per-user basis. Each person on your account can have their own personal API key, and these keys should not be shared. This lets you keep track of changes that are made across your organization. You can create and manage personal API keys via the NerdGraph API or in the NerdGraph API explorer. Some users can use these UI options: Create personal API keys via UI To generate an API key for a user from the UI: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > Users and roles. Select the user and click the API keys tab. Select + New API key. When prompted, confirm key creation.

All users can use these UI options: Create personal API keys via NerdGraph API explorer To generate an API key for a user from the NerdGraph API explorer: Navigate to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and sign in if prompted. Click the API keys dropdown. Under Create a new API key, select an account. REST API key Before you can use New Relic's REST API or the API Explorer, you must have a REST API key for your New Relic account. For master accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Only the account owner or admin can generate a REST API key for the account and each sub-account. Then, users in the account or sub-account can use the REST API key to view (but not add, change, or delete) data from the New Relic REST API and API Explorer. Availability: Each New Relic account can have one REST API key. Activate REST API key To activate API access: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key. Select (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. Regenerate REST API key To change your account's REST API key: Select [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key. Confirm the deletion of the previous REST API key by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Regenerate. Copy the new REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select (Show key).

Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Admin's API key Requirements and availability: Not available for users on the New Relic One user model, including accounts on our newer pricing plan. Requires an Owner or Admin user role. Each user can have one personal Admin user's API key per account. Use the New Relic Admin user's API key to manage access to the REST API and API Explorer. Users can use the account REST API key to view data with the API Explorer while Owners and Admins can use an Admin user's API key to view, add, change, or delete data. The Admin user's API key grants full permissions to use the New Relic REST API and API Explorer, including GET > List, POST > Create, PUT > Add or Update, and DELETE functions. In addition, you must use your Admin API key to manage dashboards using the API Explorer functions, including CREATE > Post, UPDATE > Put, SHOW > Get, SHOW > List, and DELETE functions. Other account users cannot view dashboard data from the API Explorer or use the Dashboard API functions. Activate Admin user's API key To activate Admin API access: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Next to your name, select the generate [regenerate icon] icon to generate your Admin user's API key. Select (Show key) to view your new Admin user's API key. Copy your Admin user's API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View Admin's API key An index of Admin user's API keys appears below the account's REST API key. The list includes the Admin's full name and the date their key was last used. You can view your own Admin user's API key: From the Admin index, select (Show key) for your name. You can only view other Admin's names. The keys for all other Admins are partially obscured. Regenerate Admin user's API key To change an Admin user's API key: Select the Admin user's [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key icon. Confirm the deletion of the previous Admin user's API key by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Regenerate. Copy the new Admin user's API key to use with New Relic's REST API. Delete an Admin's API key If you delete an Admin from the New Relic account, or change their role from Admin to User or Restricted user, this will also automatically remove their Admin user's API key. To delete an Admin user's API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings > API keys. From the list of Admins, locate the person whose key must be deleted. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon for the REST API key or the Admin user's API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insert API key Tips on availability and access: Because Insert API keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to an Insert API key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insert API keys for different applications or different data sources. This key is required for sending data via the Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via our integrations that use these APIs. This key reports custom data to New Relic, including event, log, metric, or trace data. Once your custom data is sent to us, you can query and visualize that data. Generate an Insert API key To register an Insert API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings. Select API keys, and then select Insights API keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the plus symbol and follow the instructions. Edit or delete an Insert API key To edit or delete an Insert API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings. Select API keys, and then select Insights API keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Query key Use this key to query data via New Relic's query APIs. Structure queries including your key based on the specifications for the API you're working with. Generate a Query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify a Query key. Query keys are generated for an account. They are not associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Query key can use it. To register an Query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short, clear description of the key. Select Save your notes. Edit or delete a Query key To edit or delete an Query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete.

The agent now reports the gRPC status code rather than \"translating\" to HTTP status codes. Vert.x The Java agent now provides visibility into your applications built using the Vert.x 3.8. The agent instruments Vert.x Web, Vert.x Core, and Vert.x HTTP client. With this instrumentation, the agent will identify and name your transactions based on Vert.x web routing paths. The agent will also time web handlers, track async handlers, and external calls made with Vert.x HTTP client. XML custom instrumentation The custom XML instrumentation XSD has been enhanced to support now include support for specifying leaf tracers. Class Histogram A new Class Histogram extension is now available to report heap memory details as events. Jedis Added support for Jedis 3.0.0 and higher. You can now see your Jedis calls in breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. Lettuce Instrumentation modules for Lettuce 4 and 5 are now available via the Java agent incubator. New OSS SDK We now have an open source Telemetry SDK for Java for sending telemetry data to New Relic. The current SDK supports sending dimensional metrics to the Metric API and spans to the Trace API. Fixes The Solr 7 instrumentation would not report Update JMX metrics. HttpURLConnection instrumentation produced External metrics only when network methods (getInputStream, getResponseCode) are called. MongoDB instrumentation would report duplicate metrics when applications invoked MongoClientOptions.build() more than once.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline 2. Take advantage of integrations and existing tools It’s always worth taking a little extra time to look for time-saving integrations and tools that can help to achieve your automation goals. For example, you can use IBM’s open-sourced New Relic CLI (command line interface) tool to automate a variety of tasks, such as managing New Relic Synthetics monitors; creating, editing, and deleting New Relic Alerts policies and conditions; and managing user accounts. Use IBM's New Relic CLI tool to manage your Synthetics monitors, alert policies, and user accounts. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions. Find answers on our sites and learn how to use our support portal. Run New Relic Diagnostics, our troubleshooting tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clean OPTION Options --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to use --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates artifacts inside your Nerdpack Validates artifacts inside your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:validate OPTION Options -l, --force-local The authentication profile you want to use. -r, --force-remote Force download of new schema files. --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to uset. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:Info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. The default amount of versions shown is 10 but all versions can be shown if the --all (or -a) flag is used Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:info OPTION Options -a, --all Show all versions. -i, --nerdpack-id=nerdpack-id Get info from the specified Nerdpack instead of local one. --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/).

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy.

Back to top icon Video New Relic One Programmability Online Training 46:59   Join us for this exclusive 90-minute introduction to the fundamentals of New Relic One Programmability. This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity.

On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\") { status errors { message } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message } } } Copy Fetch a single secret { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy.

Back to top icon Video New Relic One Programmability Online Training 46:59   Join us for this exclusive 90-minute introduction to the fundamentals of New Relic One Programmability. This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clean OPTION Options --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to use --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates artifacts inside your Nerdpack Validates artifacts inside your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:validate OPTION Options -l, --force-local The authentication profile you want to use. -r, --force-remote Force download of new schema files. --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to uset. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:Info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. The default amount of versions shown is 10 but all versions can be shown if the --all (or -a) flag is used Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:info OPTION Options -a, --all Show all versions. -i, --nerdpack-id=nerdpack-id Get info from the specified Nerdpack instead of local one. --profile=profile The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\") { status errors { message } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret(scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } , key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message } } } Copy Fetch a single secret { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters. Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as writing, deleting, and fetching data, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands.

      "info": "How to use AWS managed policies to grant New Relic permission to monitor your AWS services with infrastructure integrations. ",
      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. This resource contains information about creating NRQL alert conditions. For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and Streaming Alerts, see Streaming Alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use it to ensure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. The default streaming aggregation window duration is 1 minute. The minimum aggregation window is 30 seconds and the maximum is 15 minutes. Note: Baseline thresholds don't support configurable aggregation window durations. They use the 1 minute default. You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate the streaming algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. If your data is sporadic or has aggregation windows that may not have data, you can fill those gaps with a custom value or the lask known value. The default value is None. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to the condition to include your organization's procedures for handling the incident. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by the New Relic One Streaming Alerts platform. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic, or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. This often indicates that a service or entity is no longer online, or that a periodic job failed to run. You can use loss of signal detection to be notified when an signal is lost, or to ensure that violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts, close when there is no longer data being sent to New Relic. Loss of signal settings: Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration This is a timer that starts, and resets, when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we do not receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic, or the \"where\" clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline Loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration, and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we caution you against setting this value below 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, there are two options. You may choose one option or both. Close all current open violations: This will close all open violations that are related to this specific signal. It will not necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you are alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you will want to chose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The graphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to loss of signal. Based on your Incident Preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we will close all open violations first, then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: When creating a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Create a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in the field labeled \"Signal is lost after\" in minutes or seconds. Choose which action(s) to take when the signal is lost. Check the boxes to Close all current open violations and/or Open new \"lost signal\" violation to indicate how loss of signal violations should be handled for this condition. Make sure you name your condition and then save it. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. See this document for GraphQL API Examples. Please note, loss of signal detection does not work on NRQL queries that use Nested Aggregation (aka sub queries). Evaluation offset The streaming alerts platform works by moving time-bound windows of data, referred to as \"aggregation windows\" through a pipeline. You may configure the duration, or size, of an aggregation window. The default is 1 minute. When we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline, we use the timestamp on the data point to map it to the correct aggregation window. The streaming algorithm uses the server's clock time to advance the aggregation windows forward, and triggers the data to be aggregated using the function in the NRQL query. When a data point arrives at New Relic with a timestamp that is older than the duration of the aggregation window (1 minute by default), the data point may get dropped, and not evaluated by the alert condition. Evaluation Offset defines the number of aggregation windows that we keep in the queue, before we trigger aggregation, to increase the likelihood that the incoming data point will be matched to a waiting aggregation window. If there is a lot of latency before your data arrives, you will have to increase the number of aggregation windows in the evaluation offset. The current default is 3. Aggregation window and Offset evaluation toggles As indicated on the UI, the total supported latency is the multiple of the aggregation window duration times the evaluation offset. In this example, the allowed latency is 15 minutes (5 minute aggregation window X 3). If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3, with 1 minute aggregation windows. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. Fill data gaps Sometimes a signal will have one or more aggregation windows that does not contain data. This may happen for a variety or reasons, both expected and unexpected. There may be an issue with the network or the host that causes data not to be sent, or the signal may be sparse. Some signals, such as error counts, may only contain data when there are errors. The alert evaluation process needs to know how to process these gaps, and how these gaps should affect the threshold duration. We provide you with 3 gap filling options to choose from : none, last value, and static value. The default is 'none'. How to edit: In the UI, under NRQL Conditions, this control is located under condition settings > advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with . In the Nerdgraph API (preferred), you will find this node located at : actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue In the REST API Explorer, you will see this under the the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL Conditions API. Gap filling options: None : This is the default. With this option, we do not take any action on empty aggregation windows. When evaluation occurs, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. If the condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition will not be in violation. Custom static value : This option inserts the static value that you specify into the empty windows before evaluation. This option has an additional, required parameter of \"fillValue\" (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to \"0\". Last Known Value : This option inserts the last seen value in the gaps before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Nested Aggregation NRQL Alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data and open up new possibilities to alert on. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query will produce a single result thus giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. Registering the inner query alone would be equivalent. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window Assuming the alert is registered with an aggregation window of 1 minute, this inner query would produce 2 smaller windows of width 30 seconds which could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling.

You can find additional information in our how-to resource, Create NRQL alert conditions. Streaming Alerts terms and concepts signal The signal is the stream of telemetry data that you have identified to watch and alert on. We use NRQL queries as the language to define the signal. signal filter After New Relic receives your data, it gets routed to the streaming alerts platform. The WHERE clause in the NRQL query serves as a filter that defines the signal that streams through the alerts platform.

Data points are accumulated into a specific aggregation window based on the timestamp on the data point. aggregation function The NRQL query contains a function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() that specifies how the data points accumulated into an aggregation window should be processed, or calculated, to create a single data point. That aggregated data point is then passed to the alert evaluation process. streaming algorithm The streaming algorithm determines when the data in the aggregation window is processed submitted to Alert Evaluation. At this point, the streaming algorithm uses the server clock time to determine when to trigger an aggregation window to be processed. alert evaluation Alert evaluation assess a set of aggregation windows, based on the condition settings, to determine if an alert condition is violating, or recovering. Based on the threshold duration you set (for example, 5 minutes), it determines how many aggregation windows are contained within that duration. From there, it evaluates the aggregated data points within each time window. Any windows without data points are treated as a gap.

View entities To use the entity explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Entity explorer. Your monitored entities are on the left. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded alert status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter by tag or entity name There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities: Filter entities by tags: Use Filter with tags at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with production, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see Tagging. Filter by entity name: Use Search services by name at the top of the page. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent.

Distributed tracing Distributed tracing plays a very important role in the troubleshooting experience since it lets you dig into the communication pipe between the AWS Lambda function and any other artifact that function talks to during its execution. Distributed tracing also gives you valuable information regarding what each transaction is about, the time it takes to complete, and if there were errors. Inventoried Tags and Metadata We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Facet Builder New Relic’s Facet Builder for AWS Lambda instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom insights—without having to write queries. Metrics, events, and other measurement High cardinality invocation data View throughput, detailed categorized AWS Lambda performance metrics like duration, cold starts, error rate and more at any transaction percentile. Filter and facet by tags and function metadata to rapidly find the answer you’re looking for. AWS CloudWatch Metrics We capture metrics harvested from AWS CloudWatch for over 30 connected AWS services including AWS Lambda, allowing you to understand the performance of event-driven architectures that include queues and data streams. Key event AWS Lambda metrics like iterator age, dead letter errors / dead letter queue depth, and throttles can be visualized along performance data from instrumentation in your functions. Custom attributes and custom events Capture and send custom attributes or events and tag their function invocations with attributes, so you can connect your performance data to specific business KPIs, or understand the performance of specific functionality within your function. Errors and alerts Rich error analysis View all the errors that occurred in your function code and analyze all the details and error traces. Use agent APIs to define custom errors, even when your function runs as expected. Rich alert ecosystem Build alerts using NRQL, allowing you to drive alerts based on custom attributes or any function-specific attribute.

      "body": "Collect data from any source 15 min New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) 1 curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ 5 -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ 6 -d '[ 7 { 8 \"common\": { 9 \"attributes\": { 10 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 11 \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" 12 } 13 }, 14 \"spans\": [ 15 { 16 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 17 \"id\": \"ABC\", 18 \"attributes\": { 19 \"duration.ms\": 12.53, 20 \"name\": \"/home\" 21 } 22 }, 23 { 24 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 25 \"id\": \"DEF\", 26 \"attributes\": { 27 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 28 \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", 29 \"duration.ms\": 2.97, 30 \"name\": \"/auth\", 31 \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" 32 } 33 } 34 ] 35 } 36 ]' Copy Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. 1 curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"metrics\": [ 7 { 8 \"name\": \"memory.heap\", 9 \"type\": \"gauge\", 10 \"value\": 2.3, 11 \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, 12 \"attributes\": { 13 \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" 14 } 15 } 16 ] 17 } 18 ]' Copy Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", 7 \"service\": \"login-service\", 8 \"customerId\": \"xyz\" 9 } 10 ]' Copy Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 \"logs\": [ 6 { 7 \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, 8 \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", 9 \"service\": \"login-service\", 10 \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" 11 } 12 ] 13 ]' Copy",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data, which is then available for querying in New Relic. Related documentation: Add custom attributes to existing events Send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM) Custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Data considerations The New Relic agents sends event data to New Relic as part of its normal harvest cycle every 5 seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record a custom event To record a custom event, follow the procedure for your New Relic language agent: C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml:​ custom_insights_events: enabled: false For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers.

This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported.

Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query personal API keys (user keys) in similar ways, replacing the ingest-specific fields with fields specific to the API. To understand the structure of these objects, you can experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete personal API keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a personal API key: Create a personal API key To create a personal API key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.

      "body": "In New Relic, the events-to-metrics service lets you define rules for creating metrics from your event-type data. This document contains: A description of the events-to-metrics rule creation process Some requirements and tips for creating rules Some tips for querying the resulting metrics Create an events-to-metrics rule Here's an overview of creating an events-to-metrics rule: First, construct an events-to-metrics rule using NRQL. Next, construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains the NRQL rule you've created in Step 1. Finally, create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart that metric using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating an events-to-metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using a NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so you'd use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) since 1 day ago To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Once your NRQL rule is complete, you'll use it when you create the API request. Step 2. Create API request Once you've built the events-to-metrics NRQL rule, you'll build the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. In the following example NerdGraph API request, we've used the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Request elements Comments mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Step 3. Create an event-to-metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. For instructions on using this, see Use NerdGraph. Query and chart your metrics Once you've created an events-to-metrics rule, the new metric data should appear in New Relic in a few minutes. To view your data: Go to a NRQL query interface and run the following query. This will give you the name of all your metrics. SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Pick the metric of interest and run the following to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' The available NRQL aggregator functions available will depend on the metric type you've created. For example, if you've created a summary metric type, you will be able to use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Troubleshooting If you receive a message like Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C”, verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes. Rule-creation requirements and recommendations Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations for events-to-metrics rule creation: Available metric types: summary, uniqueCount, and distribution A NRQL query must use one of the following functions to aggregate metrics: summary: Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if the NRQL query you are creating a metric for uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. An example rule-creation query using summary: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host uniqueCount: Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if the NRQL query you're creating a metric for uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host distribution: Creates a distribution metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if the NRQL query you are creating a metric for uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as argument, and discard the rest of arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events matching a particular WHERE clause, you can do this by using summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events per minute. When querying the created metric, you can use the sum method to see the result. For example, if you wanted to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' and you would query it like: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago For more information on metrics, see our docs. Rule-creation limits Some limits affecting metrics creation: An account can have a maximum of 1000 metric-creation rules. A rule can create a maximum of 10 metrics. A rule can use only one event type. A rule can select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes the rule details, a message about having too many facets, and a newRelicFeature of eventToMetric. There is also a limit on total unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account, which is equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute, up to a maximum of 10M. Cardinality limits for unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Let's look at an example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Create multiple metrics with one rule An events-to-metrics rule can create up to 10 metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Here's an example of creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Metric naming: rules and recommendations A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. For example, in the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Recommendations for naming: We recommend keeping your keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may have namespaces that you want to prefix your metric name with or your names may need to be more general. If you do want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right), using a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names, and using an underscore to separate words within the dots (for example, application.page_view.duration). Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you might use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name and you will need to specify the older metric name in order to query or chart that historical data.

      "body": "You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Read on to learn about the New Relic containerized private minion (CPM), a Docker container-based private minion that accepts and executes synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for New Relic right now. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on high availability integration, see the Prometheus High Availability resource. Set up the integration From the Prometheus remote write setup page, complete these steps. Enter a name for the Prometheus server you’re connecting to and your remote_write URL. The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data, and will be the name used to identify which Prometheus server you're connecting to. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. A good place to add this information is under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. We recommend to use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME> bearer_token:<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Alternatively, you could use this configuration: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>&prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME> If you are completing the remote write integration using Kubernetes and Helm, you should instead add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the example below. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME> bearerToken:<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Restart your Prometheus server. View your data. Add Prometheus data Customize remote write behavior You may be interested in customizing the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. Details: If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts you should use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. You should use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Troubleshooting the integration If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. Common errors and issues: Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error. If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large. This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error. This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following: Run a query on the error message using NRQL then look at the Message field in UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>. Remove the integration To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file and restart the server. When you remove the integration, this stops new data from flowing, but will not purge or remove any historical data.

Back to top icon New Relic Browser Overview Features Resources New Relic Browser features Sign up for free Page Load Performance JavaScript Errors Browser Performance AJAX Global Features Security Page Load Performance New Relic Browser is the world’s most deployed Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution because it’s easy to use, and instantly connects end-user experience with time spent in backend services. From easy-to-understand overviews to user-centric perceived performance metrics and events, Browser helps you benchmark and improve web performance and troubleshoot across your full stack. Full Support for Google’s Core Web Vitals By adding Cumulative Layout Shift, a score measuring the impact of sudden unexpected shifts in layout due to content dynamically resizing, we now offer full support for all three of Google’s Core Web Vitals for web health. Use NRQL to create dashboards for all three measurements, definitions below: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - measures loading performance First Input Delay (FID) - measures interactivity Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - measures visual stability User Centric Perceived Performance Web performance teams can use more modern metrics than just page load time to benchmark and improve end-user experience for their dynamic pages. Browser helps developers understand how code impacts customers, answering key questions on page performance. Monitor how long users wait for content to display (paint metrics), how long until users can interact with our page (interactivity metrics), and how long until marquee content renders (largest contentful paint). (see blogpost for more) Single Page App Route Changes View Single Page Application route change performance, regardless of what JavaScript framework you use. Powerful low-level instrumentation can even capture interactions beyond the route change that can be customized via API, allowing monitoring tailored to the architecture of your application, such as for custom frameworks. Session Traces Session Traces provide one of the most valuable assets an engineer requires - context. Beyond identifying long load times, and specific errors, Browser Session Traces provide the story that occurred both before and after an error or performance issue. Pivot from AJAX requests and JavaScript errors into a Session Trace and conversely pivot from a Session Trace out to a specific JavaScript error or Network error. Browser Traces Traces are snapshots of one user’s experience, surfaced as an outlier due to a longer than average load time. It provides details around when it took place, a segmented breakdown of where load time was spent, browser type, and the user’s geographic location. This report is excellent when dissecting areas of your application which are performing poorly for specific users. Page Load Time - Segmentation Chart Page load times capture metrics from the moment a user begins a transaction in the browser until the page completes loading. The reports show average page load time broken down into color-coded segments for: Request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Page Load Time - Histogram and Percentiles Histograms and percentiles of browser page load times provide a holistic view of the speed of page loads, one that is not focused on averages alone. Histograms and percentiles surface every page load that occurred during a specified time window, providing the ability to drill into outliers that might have been overlooked otherwise. Geographic Reporting Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region. Identify if more CDN’s are required, or if high value customers in specific parts of the world are having a negative experience with your site’s performance. Page-Level AJAX Calls For a specific page, see all the AJAX calls being made as well as the response time, throughput (rpm), total number of calls, error status codes, and average data transfer made for each one. Page View Throughput Throughput is measured in requests per per minute. Throughput metrics help you understand which pages are being called most frequently. Connect Browser with Backend Performance From the Page views report, you can select single page URL and see all of the associated backend APM transactions (if you have the APM Agent installed in your application). Quickly view the total call time, average response time, and call count for any individual backend transaction. You can also dive deeper into a particular transaction and see diagnostics within our APM reports. JavaScript Errors The JavaScript error dashboards help you identify production JavaScript errors impacting your users' experiences and begin pinpointing how to resolve them. JavaScript Error Summary This summary view gives you a high level understanding of the types of JavaScript errors happening, the frequency at which they occur, and the percentage of users affected by the errors. Errors by Browser For each type of error, this chart shows you which browsers are being impacted by the error and the relative contribution it is making to your total error volume. Percentage of Page Views with Errors For each type of error, this chart shows you the percentage of page views affected by it. This allows you to quickly assess the reach and impact a particular error has on your end users. Source Map Support Troubleshoot minified production JavaScript code, with source map support giving you full visibility to where in your code the front-end error is. Intuitive drag-and-drop lets you locate issues in a click, while API integrations work seamlessly with your build pipeline. Best-in-class Customer Experience Monitoring Crash analysis in New Relic Mobile lets you analyze the most impactful crashes and fix them faster. Source map support in New Relic Browser gives you more actionable visibility into front-end JS errors by showing you exactly where in the original source the error occurred, even if your code is minified. Browser Performance New Relic's Browser dashboards provide information about your end users' experience based on browser type and version, so you can understand where to focus your time testing and optimizing for performance. Browser Throughput Provides a snapshot of the average number of pageviews received per minute broken down by browser type. Browser Load Time - Segmentation Chart For each type of browser, a segmented view of time spent on request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Browser Version Chart Helps you understand which versions of each browser type your customers come from based on throughput. Error Instance Details Error Instance details grabs a snapshot of a single error and captures the stack trace details available from the browser, focusing on the actionable components, down to the line of code. These are metrics are combined with unique browser combinations down to the version level, and unique url. JavaScript diagnostics doesn't get more granular than this. AJAX If your applications use AJAX to update parts of a webpage after the initial page load, our AJAX dashboards will provide you with the level of visibility you need to understand how those requests are performing and ultimately affecting your users’ experience. AJAX Dashboard The main AJAX dashboard surfaces your site’s most resource intensive AJAX requests, filterable by time consumption, response time, throughput, callback time, and data transfer. From here you can drill into a particular call for detailed analysis. Calls by Page View Shows which page views are calling a particular server side controller, with page level detail around throughput, response time, total number of calls, and data transfer. Request Status Codes The status codes reporting indicates the return behavior from an AJAX call. A large number of non-200 status codes may indicate a problem with your AJAX endpoints. Data Transfer Per Request This shows data transfer which is requested and sent. Use this to look for correlations between high callback times and data transfer rates. Global Features The following features are used throughout New Relic’s product suite to help make our products easier to use and fit seamlessly into your existing workflows. Quickly View App Health New Relic uses color coded status indicators throughout to help you quickly spot performance issues. Custom dashboards Keep an eye on your most critical performance metrics quickly by adding them to a custom dashboard. Integrate with your ticketing system File tickets related to performance problems directly into your ticketing system. Learn which ticketing systems we support. Alerting Check out our new Alerts Features for Browser that report on JS error %, response time, throughput and much more! Filterable Geography Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region, down to the city level. Identify how a CDN or ASN/ Internet Service Provider is performing in different regions. Security New Relic is committed to helping customers make their applications fast and secure. We take protecting our customers' data seriously, here's an overview of how we do it. U.S. and EU Data Regions Our global data-hosting structure consists of two regions: European Union and United States. You can select your preferred data region during the account setup process, regardless of your physical location. (Note: We do not support migration or aggregation of data across regions.) SOC2 Audited New Relic has successfully completed a SOC 2 audit of processes and controls relevant to security and availability. This audit reviews our security process and controls and provides both ourselves, and more importantly our customers an independent, third-party assurance that we are taking the appropriate steps to protect our systems and our customer’s data. Secure Data Center The infrastructure that runs the New Relic service and stores our customer’s data resides in a Tier III, SSAE-16 certified data center. Customer data is backed up on a regular basis. Continuous Monitoring New Relic employs both internal and third-party services to perform continuous security scanning on both our network and applications to ensure that our applications and servers remain secure. Secure by Default We strongly believe in the concept of “secure by default”. Customers have to explicitly enable settings within New Relic to authorize the sending of sensitive data. We want to make sure that you are not accidentally exposing anything that you don’t want to. Compliance Friendly New Relic can be configured to operate securely in regulated environments such as PCI, HIPAA, or SOX. In addition we are Swiss and EU Privacy Shield certified.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "info": "Intro to NerdStorage on New Relic One",
      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda offers in-depth performance monitoring for your Lambda functions. Read on to learn how to enable this feature using our Lambda layer and get started using it. Using this feature may result in AWS charges. See Lambda monitoring requirements.​​​​​​​​​​ How does it work When you enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda extension, this is what happens: Lambda monitoring with the New Relic Lambda layer You configure your Lambda function to include our layer for the runtime you've chosen. As your code runs, our Lambda layer gathers telemetry data about the invocation and its execution. Just before execution finishes, the Lambda layer sends the data it has gathered to the New Relic Lambda extension, which is bundled with the layer. The extension sends the data to New Relic, along with additional information from AWS Lambda. What's in the New Relic Lambda layer? The layer for your runtime contains the New Relic Lambda extension. This executable extends your Lambda function. The extension sends telemetry data to New Relic, and interacts with AWS directly to enhance the data we gather, while minimizing the impact of instrumentation on your application's performance. For Node.js and Python, the layer contains the New Relic agent code, and a wrapper for your Lambda handler. For other runtimes, we take an SDK approach, providing you with the tools to instrument your code, while taking advantage of emerging standards like OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry. What do you need To enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you need the following: AWS CLI v2 installed and configured using aws configure. Python version 3.3 or higher installed. newrelic-lambda CLI, which you can install by running pip install newrelic-lambda-cli. A New Relic account. You must be an admin, or have the Infrastructure manager add-on role. An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets. Note that you may need to use pip3 instead of pip if your system uses Python 2 by default. Enable serverless monitoring There are a few things that have to happen to let New Relic gather telemetry from your Lambda functions. Link your AWS account with your New Relic account. Configure each of your functions to include our Lambda extension. While there are several ways to accomplish both steps, this guide focuses on the most frequent setup scenario. Link your AWS account with your New Relic account When you link your AWS account to New Relic, you're granting permission to New Relic to create an inventory of your AWS account, and gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. Resources in your AWS account then show up as entities in the entity explorer, decorated with config information. When all the requirements are in place, link your AWS account with your New Relic account by running the following command (replace all the highlighted values): newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --linked-account-name YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME \\ --nr-api-key YOUR_NR_API_KEY \\ --enable-license-key-secret The newrelic-lambda CLI adds your New Relic License Key as a secret in AWS Secret Manager for greater security. The --linked-account-name parameter is to name the integration that will appear in New Relic. Storing the New Relic license key in the AWS Secrets Manager Your New Relic license key identifies and authenticates you to New Relic, allowing us to associate your telemetry with your New Relic account. Each function that sends telemetry needs access to this value, and it needs to be managed securely. The AWS Secrets Manager solves these problems. Install or upgrade the Lambda layer After linking your accounts, you have to install or upgrade the New Relic Lambda layer to the latest version. All future layers versions will include the Lambda extension by default. To install/upgrade the layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Enable the Lambda extension The extension is disabled by default. To enable it after adding or updating the Lambda layer, set the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to any value in your function configuration: aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function --environment \"Variables={NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED=true}\" This command overwrites any environment variables you currently have configured for your function. To get the environment variables configured, run: aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name my-function --output text --query \"Environment.Variables\" Deploy our examples and verify they work Once you've linked your AWS and New Relic accounts, instrumenting your Lambda function using our Lambda extension involves a series of steps: Pick an example and install it. Invoke the Lambda and see data in New Relic. Clean up and adapt the example to your code. We recommend trying out our example code for the following languages: Node.js Python Go Java .NET Each example contains instructions, sample code, and a deploy script to get started. After you've gotten the example to work for you, you can clean up by deleting the CloudFormation stack, using either the AWS Console, or the AWS CLI: aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name> Our examples are based on the AWS SAM CLI. There are other tools available for managing and deploying Lambda functions. New Relic offers a plugin for the Serverless Framework, and the CLI can modify your existing Lambda functions to add instrumentation. You can integrate the necessary Lambda layer and function permission using whatever AWS resource management tool you choose. Troubleshooting Multiple AWS regions and accounts The newrelic-lambda CLI should be run once per region, with the --aws-region parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The license key secret needs to be created in each region. Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The --aws-profile argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: Adapt the example code to your Lambda functions to start monitoring production code. See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting. Use configuration settings to fine-tune your data.

When using... ... use this key NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most data that New Relic collects and to do some management tasks Personal API key Our APIs for event, log, metric, or trace data. Insert API key Our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, or Mobile REST APIs; and the API Explorer. REST API key (or Personal API key) Admin-only functionality with the REST API and API Explorer; or with the Synthetics API. Admin’s API key (or Personal API key) One of New Relic's query APIs to query data. Query API key Personal API key If you are a user on our New Relic One user model, including accounts on our newer pricing plan, you cannot manage this API key from the UI. Instead, use NerdGraph or the NerdGraph API explorer. Learn more. This API key allows you to use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and the REST API. You can use NerdGraph to query entities, see relationships between them, add tags to entities, and more. Personal API keys are generated on a per-user basis. Each person on your account can have their own personal API key, and these keys should not be shared. This lets you keep track of changes that are made across your organization. You can create and manage personal API keys via the NerdGraph API or in the NerdGraph API explorer. Some users can use these UI options: Create personal API keys via UI To generate an API key for a user from the UI: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > Users and roles. Select the user and click the API keys tab. Select + New API key. When prompted, confirm key creation. View personal API keys via UI You cannot view another user's entire API key, only the first few characters. Restricted users also cannot view their personal API key. To view your personal API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > Users and roles. Select your name from the list of users. Select the API keys tab to view your personal keys. Delete personal API keys via UI To delete a personal API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > Users and roles. Select the user. Select the API keys tab. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon. All users can use these UI options: Create personal API keys via NerdGraph API explorer To generate an API key for a user from the NerdGraph API explorer: Navigate to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and sign in if prompted. Click the API keys dropdown. Under Create a new API key, select an account. REST API key Before you can use New Relic's REST API or the API Explorer, you must have a REST API key for your New Relic account. For master accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Only the account owner or admin can generate a REST API key for the account and each sub-account. Then, users in the account or sub-account can use the REST API key to view (but not add, change, or delete) data from the New Relic REST API and API Explorer. Availability: Each New Relic account can have one REST API key. Activate REST API key To activate API access: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key. Select (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. Regenerate REST API key To change your account's REST API key: Select [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key. Confirm the deletion of the previous REST API key by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Regenerate. Copy the new REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select (Show key). Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Admin's API key Requirements and availability: Not available for users on the New Relic One user model, including accounts on our newer pricing plan. Requires an Owner or Admin user role. Each user can have one personal Admin user's API key per account. Use the New Relic Admin user's API key to manage access to the REST API and API Explorer. Users can use the account REST API key to view data with the API Explorer while Owners and Admins can use an Admin user's API key to view, add, change, or delete data. The Admin user's API key grants full permissions to use the New Relic REST API and API Explorer, including GET > List, POST > Create, PUT > Add or Update, and DELETE functions. In addition, you must use your Admin API key to manage dashboards using the API Explorer functions, including CREATE > Post, UPDATE > Put, SHOW > Get, SHOW > List, and DELETE functions. Other account users cannot view dashboard data from the API Explorer or use the Dashboard API functions. Activate Admin user's API key To activate Admin API access: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and go to Account settings > API keys. Next to your name, select the generate [regenerate icon] icon to generate your Admin user's API key. Select (Show key) to view your new Admin user's API key. Copy your Admin user's API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View Admin's API key An index of Admin user's API keys appears below the account's REST API key. The list includes the Admin's full name and the date their key was last used. You can view your own Admin user's API key: From the Admin index, select (Show key) for your name. You can only view other Admin's names. The keys for all other Admins are partially obscured. Regenerate Admin user's API key To change an Admin user's API key: Select the Admin user's [regenerate icon] Regenerate REST API key icon. Confirm the deletion of the previous Admin user's API key by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Regenerate. Copy the new Admin user's API key to use with New Relic's REST API. Delete an Admin's API key If you delete an Admin from the New Relic account, or change their role from Admin to User or Restricted user, this will also automatically remove their Admin user's API key. To delete an Admin user's API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings > API keys. From the list of Admins, locate the person whose key must be deleted. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon for the REST API key or the Admin user's API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insert API key Tips on availability and access: Because Insert API keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to an Insert API key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insert API keys for different applications or different data sources. This key is required for sending data via the Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via our integrations that use these APIs. This key reports custom data to New Relic, including event, log, metric, or trace data. Once your custom data is sent to us, you can query and visualize that data. Generate an Insert API key To register an Insert API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings. Select API keys, and then select Insights API keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the plus symbol and follow the instructions. Edit or delete an Insert API key To edit or delete an Insert API key: Click your username in one.newrelic.com and select Account settings. Select API keys, and then select Insights API keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Query key Use this key to query data via New Relic's query APIs. Structure queries including your key based on the specifications for the API you're working with. Generate a Query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify a Query key. Query keys are generated for an account. They are not associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Query key can use it. To register an Query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short, clear description of the key. Select Save your notes. Edit or delete a Query key To edit or delete an Query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete.

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/).

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can see it directly on their homepage.",

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Warning NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

We allow this so that if you have an incident, your team members can upgrade and quickly work on problems. A basic user always has the capabilities of a basic user, no more and no less. This is true even if a basic user is assigned to a group that has very limited capabilities. Learn more about basic users and roles. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Where you manage users in the UI depends on their user model: For users on our New Relic One user model (true for New Relic organizations created on or after July 30 2020): To add users: from one.newrelic.com, select Apps from the top navigation, and select User management. For managing roles and groups, see Groups, roles, and access grants. For users on our original user model: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and click Users and roles. User type: basic and full The user type determines the monitoring and analysis features a user has access to, and is a key factor in billing. (Note that user type does not control account admin-related permissions; that's determined by the user group.) There are two user types: Basic user: These users are free and have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features. For details, see Capabilities. No matter what group a basic user is assigned to, it always has the capabilities of a basic user, no more and no less. Full user: These users are billable and have access to Full-Stack Observability capabilities, including our curated UI experiences, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. The Standard pricing tier includes one full user for free and up to five full users total. Are you switching from original pricing to New Relic One pricing? Learn about updating your users. Or learn more about user-related billing calculation. To understand more about basic users and full users: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a detailed table showing differences between basic user and full user capabilities. In short, basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and Applied Intelligence (read-only) features, while full users have access to that plus Full-Stack Observability features.

Learn more about user-related billing calculations. Tips on choosing user type Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. Learn more about user-related billing calculations. Are you switching from our original pricing plan to New Relic One pricing? Learn about how to convert your users. User groups This section applies to New Relic One pricing accounts with users on the New Relic One user model. If you have users on our original user model, see the original user model docs. You can add users to user groups. There are two default user groups: User: Adding someone to this group allows them to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. Admin: Adding someone to this group gives them the abilities of the User group and also gives them access to account/organization-related abilities like managing billing-related settings and managing users. Learn more about the roles and capabilities that define these default groups. Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can create their own custom roles and custom groups. Billing calculations For user-related billing calculations, see Calculations. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Capability limitations For users on the New Relic One user model, there are some limitations, mainly around API access. For details, see Limitations.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Original user model For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions. Who are these docs for? This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you very likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check the user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, these users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of pricing plan and user models. View and manage users To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. User types: basic user and full user On the Users and roles UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. This only affects your account once you've switched to the New Relic One pricing plan, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. Your users on our original user model remain on that user model (and use these original user docs) and additionally have the new full/basic categorization. To learn more, see Transition to new pricing. You can also bulk update changes to user type. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select plus-circle New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select pencil Edit role or trash-o Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. fa-check Change the account Owner. fa-check Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. fa-check fa-check Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic.

      "body": "Our F5 BIG-IP integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Access Auditor-level user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. F5 BIG-IP users and privileges To create a new user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Access Auditor-level permissions. For instructions, see the F5 official documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see User role access descriptions. For detailed information on iControl users and permission, download and review the iControl REST User Guide. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example of the configuration file, see the example config file. With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The f5-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metrics for the BIG-IP instance. inventory: collects only the inventory (configuration) data for the BIG-IP instance. metrics: collects only the metrics data for the BIG-IP instance. Arguments The f5-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: username: The username for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. password: The password for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. hostname: The hostname for the F5 BIG-IP connection. Default: f5-host. port: The port on which F5 BIG-IP instance is running. Default: 443. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 30. use_ssl: Indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the API. The F5 API only allows connections using SSL by default. ca_bundle_file: Alternative certificate authority bundle file. ca_bundle_dir: Alternative certificate authority bundle directory. partition_filter: An array of the partitions to collect from, in JSON. Default: '[\"Common\"]'. Example configuration Example f5-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration integration_name: com.newrelic.f5 instances: - name: nri-f5 # command can be all_data, metrics, or inventory command: all_data arguments: # Username of the F5 instance username: admin # Password of the F5 instance password: admin # Hostname of the F5 instance hostname: f5-host # Port of the F5 instance port: 443 # CA certificate file ca_bundle_file: /etc/ca_certificate.crt # A JSON array of BIG-IP partitions to collect from. # The partition name should have no leading slash. # Defaults to '[\"Common\"]' partition_filter: '[\"Common\",\"MyOtherPartition\"]' # The number of seconds to wait before a request times out # Defaults to 30 timeout: 10 For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. This resource contains information about creating NRQL alert conditions. For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and Streaming Alerts, see Streaming Alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use it to ensure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. The default streaming aggregation window duration is 1 minute. The minimum aggregation window is 30 seconds and the maximum is 15 minutes. Note: Baseline thresholds don't support configurable aggregation window durations. They use the 1 minute default. You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate the streaming algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. If your data is sporadic or has aggregation windows that may not have data, you can fill those gaps with a custom value or the lask known value. The default value is None. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to the condition to include your organization's procedures for handling the incident. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. A loss of signal is a period of time when no data is received by the New Relic One Streaming Alerts platform. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic, or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. This often indicates that a service or entity is no longer online, or that a periodic job failed to run. You can use loss of signal detection to be notified when an signal is lost, or to ensure that violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts, close when there is no longer data being sent to New Relic. Loss of signal settings: Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration This is a timer that starts, and resets, when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we do not receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic, or the \"where\" clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline Loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration, and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we caution you against setting this value below 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, there are two options. You may choose one option or both. Close all current open violations: This will close all open violations that are related to this specific signal. It will not necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you are alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you will want to chose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The graphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to loss of signal. Based on your Incident Preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we will close all open violations first, then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: When creating a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Create a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in the field labeled \"Signal is lost after\" in minutes or seconds. Choose which action(s) to take when the signal is lost. Check the boxes to Close all current open violations and/or Open new \"lost signal\" violation to indicate how loss of signal violations should be handled for this condition. Make sure you name your condition and then save it. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. See this document for GraphQL API Examples. Please note, loss of signal detection does not work on NRQL queries that use Nested Aggregation (aka sub queries). Evaluation offset The streaming alerts platform works by moving time-bound windows of data, referred to as \"aggregation windows\" through a pipeline. You may configure the duration, or size, of an aggregation window. The default is 1 minute. When we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline, we use the timestamp on the data point to map it to the correct aggregation window. The streaming algorithm uses the server's clock time to advance the aggregation windows forward, and triggers the data to be aggregated using the function in the NRQL query. When a data point arrives at New Relic with a timestamp that is older than the duration of the aggregation window (1 minute by default), the data point may get dropped, and not evaluated by the alert condition. Evaluation Offset defines the number of aggregation windows that we keep in the queue, before we trigger aggregation, to increase the likelihood that the incoming data point will be matched to a waiting aggregation window. If there is a lot of latency before your data arrives, you will have to increase the number of aggregation windows in the evaluation offset. The current default is 3. Aggregation window and Offset evaluation toggles As indicated on the UI, the total supported latency is the multiple of the aggregation window duration times the evaluation offset. In this example, the allowed latency is 15 minutes (5 minute aggregation window X 3). If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3, with 1 minute aggregation windows. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. Fill data gaps Sometimes a signal will have one or more aggregation windows that does not contain data. This may happen for a variety or reasons, both expected and unexpected. There may be an issue with the network or the host that causes data not to be sent, or the signal may be sparse. Some signals, such as error counts, may only contain data when there are errors. The alert evaluation process needs to know how to process these gaps, and how these gaps should affect the threshold duration. We provide you with 3 gap filling options to choose from : none, last value, and static value. The default is 'none'. How to edit: In the UI, under NRQL Conditions, this control is located under condition settings > advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with . In the Nerdgraph API (preferred), you will find this node located at : actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue In the REST API Explorer, you will see this under the the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL Conditions API. Gap filling options: None : This is the default. With this option, we do not take any action on empty aggregation windows. When evaluation occurs, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. If the condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition will not be in violation. Custom static value : This option inserts the static value that you specify into the empty windows before evaluation. This option has an additional, required parameter of \"fillValue\" (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to \"0\". Last Known Value : This option inserts the last seen value in the gaps before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Nested Aggregation NRQL Alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data and open up new possibilities to alert on. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query will produce a single result thus giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. Registering the inner query alone would be equivalent. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window Assuming the alert is registered with an aggregation window of 1 minute, this inner query would produce 2 smaller windows of width 30 seconds which could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction New Relic Browser events, like PageView New Relic Mobile events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:​ SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... SELECT function(attribute) ... The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 1,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 1:00 through 3:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Use automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Use sliding windows With sliding windows, data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. Sliding windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use sliding windows, use the SLIDE BY argument in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Use sliding windows with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO ​​This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Query metric data There are several ways to query metric data using NRQL: Query metric timeslice data, which is reported by New Relic APM, Mobile, Browser Query the Metric data type, which is reported by some of our integrations and Telemetry SDKs For more on understanding metrics in New Relic, see Metric data types. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Here are the available aggregator functions. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]​) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 However, depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.

      "body": "You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including the New Relic Event API, APM agent APIs, Browser agent APIs, and the Mobile SDK. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent. Additional Event API requirements For more requirements and details for the Event API, see Event API. Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.
