This reduces the requests related to fetching tags by approximately 90% for selected AWS integrations, and reduces throttling considerably. This feature requires new permissions: We sent a communication with instructions to all customers without the required permissions for the following integrations: ALB, CloudFront, DynamoDB, ECS, EFS, Elastic BeanStalk, ElastiCache, ElasticSearch, ELB, Kinesis Streams, Lambda, RDS, Route53, SQS and S3. The new permissions can be enabled till August 5th 2020. If you have questions or doubts about this change, reach out the New Relic account team. Azure AppService Integration: WebApp slots are now supported. AWS DocumentDB Integration: support for tags. The following integrations have been launched as beta: [Beta] GCP Cloud Run [Beta] GCP Firebase Hosting [Beta] GCP Firebase Database [Beta] GCP Firebase Storage [Beta] GCP Firestore [Beta] AWS Transit Gateway",

In the filter, tag keys and values are grouped under the Labels category so they can be more easily found. The AWS ALB integration now collects tags for ALB Target Groups that can be used in NQRL queries and dashboard filters. You can also fine-tune the data gathered with this integration by specifying the resource tag key and value you want to monitor with the new Filter by tag. Please refer to Configure polling frequency and data collection for cloud integrations for details. The AWS API Gateway integration now collects tags for stages, resources and methods, which can be used in NQRL queries and dashboard filters. The AWS Redis Cache integration now collects the OperationsPerSecond metric, which reports the number of commands processed per second by the cache server. Changes The threshold selector in Infrastructure Integrations Alerts now includes the metric unit, so it's much easier to configure the correct threshold value. It is available for RDS metrics, and shall be available in other services soon. The BucketSizeBytes metric for AWS S3 buckets was returning only the size of Standard Storage objects contained in the bucket. Now the metric returns the aggregated size of all storage types. Note the BucketSizeBytes metric is included in the DatastoreSample event type with a provider value of S3Bucket.",

They join BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage integrations, which were collecting labels already. With the appropriate permissions, you'll be able to use the following metadata to narrow down queries, dashboards, and alerts related to Google Cloud resources: Labels for Functions. Labels for SQL databases. Labels for Kubernetes clusters, which are propagated to nodes, pods and containers. If you'd like entity specific labels to be collected, you can use the Kubernetes integration. Labels and tags for Compute Engine virtual machines, and labels for disks. Tags are treated as a regular label with value true. Additionally, Inventory for Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Functions has been enhanced with new attributes and restructured, so it's easier to find the metadata that belongs to each entity. The aforementioned improvements might cause an unexpected volume of Entity modified events, as Inventory will be updated with the new data.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system‚Äôs architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the entity explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it‚Äôs still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don‚Äôt need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven‚Äôt configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren‚Äôt any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. For more information, check out New Relic University‚Äôs tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.

      "info": "How to use tags to improve organization and findability of your observability data. ",
      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who‚Äôs responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you‚Äôll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity‚Äôs name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the entity explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Entity explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity‚Äôs metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's ellipsis icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the information icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace all the existing values for a tag with new ones: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.

      "info": "Using the New Relic NerdGraph API, you can drop some specific types of data that meet the criteria you set. ",
      "body": "For some types of data in New Relic, you can drop (not report) that data. You might want to do this: To filter out unimportant, low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following types of data can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop events meeting certain criteria Let‚Äôs say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don‚Äôt look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or Nerd-Graph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and Browser apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies Nerd-Graph API.

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose high response times in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds‚Äîor 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time‚Äîless than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds‚Äîor 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time‚Äîless than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

In either case, all props are 1:1 compatible with the <NrqlQuery> format type CHART. A common case to render one row per NRQL facet, is to perform the query outside of the table, then pass the result as items (returned data from a <NrqlQuery> is an array, that can be directly used as the input items of a table). Once rendering the sparkline, you need to re-wrap the data in an array, in order to build, from a series, a new entire set of data.

Table can only contain as children <TableHeader> and a function returning <TableRow>s. function () => undefined classNamestring Appends class names to the component. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row. Often the first column (index 0) is the relevant one, but actions (like favorites) could be placed before it. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : {Object // Items to load. ) => undefined onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function () => undefined rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( args : {Object ) => undefined spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property. Spacing is defined as a tuple of zero to four values, which follow the same conventions as CSS properties like margin or padding. To omit a value, use SPACING_TYPE.OMIT. <Array of <One of Table.SPACING_TYPE.EXTRA_LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM , Table.SPACING_TYPE.NONE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.OMIT , Table.SPACING_TYPE.SMALL , > > styleobject Inline style for custom styling.

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "[RSS] Released on:¬† Monday, January 11, 2021 - 09:30 Download New Diagnostics CLI will validate the Java agent configuration that has been done through Java System Properties. Infra/Env/NrjmxBeans - Validates that the mbeans that the user wants to query with the New Relic JMX integration are available for the integration to pull from. This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format. Changes The product will now be known as Diagnostics CLI Diagnostics CLI is proud to announce that is codebase is now part of New Relic's Open Source Community: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli",

You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they‚Äôve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren‚Äôt an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.

Adding agent data to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in New Relic One. This document explains how to add agent data to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. For example, to deploy with native support for a Flask/Django app: Follow standard procedures to install the Python agent, including your license key. Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE as an environment variable pointing to newrelic.ini. Once the agent and configuration file have been installed, the Python agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add agent data to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Our GAE flex examples on Github for Python Google App Engine's documentation for Python Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Python app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies When building a custom runtime using Docker, set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE as an environment variable pointing to the Dockerfile instead of to your Python app's newrelic.ini. Follow standard procedures to install the Python agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures Python to create a Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK also provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example shows the Python agent installed for an application served with gunicorn. These procedures are similar to the Python quick start guide. The Dockerfile will contain customer-specific code, including Python version, installation requirements, etc). # [START dockerfile] FROM gcr.io/google_appengine/python # Install the fortunes binary from the debian repositories. RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y fortunes # Optional: Change the -p argument to use Python 2.7. RUN virtualenv /env -p python3.5 # Set virtualenv environment variables. This is equivalent to running # source /env/bin/activate. ENV VIRTUAL_ENV /env ENV PATH /env/bin:$PATH ADD requirements.txt /app/ RUN pip install -r requirements.txt ADD . /app/ CMD NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app # [END dockerfile] 4. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse To view your GAE flex app data, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect Python agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, add the following statement to the newrelic.ini configuration: log_file = stderr To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you‚Äôre looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 Œºs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is ‚Äúloading‚Äù its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors‚Äîand more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions. Find answers on our sites and learn how to use our support portal. Run New Relic Diagnostics, our troubleshooting tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "Use secrets variables in your New Relic infrastructure integration configuration to inject sensitive data that you don‚Äôt want in your configuration files.",
      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server‚Äôs certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true New Relic CLI Obfuscation We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application‚Äôs ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application‚Äôs index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application‚Äôs ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you‚Äôve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

Infra/Env/NrjmxBeans - Validates that the mbeans that the user wants to query with the New Relic JMX integration are available for the integration to pull from. This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format.

      "info": "Add tags to applications you instrument for easier filtering and organization.",
      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "[RSS] Released on:¬† Thursday, February 27, 2020 - 16:30 Notes Follow standard procedures to install or update the New Relic integration for Kubernetes. Changelog Added: support for querying Kube State Metrics (KSM) instances behind kube-rbac-proxy. This feature only works when paired with the label-based KSM discovery (see release notes of version 1.11.0 for more information). This adds two new environment variables that allow deeper configuration of the feature: KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME: Whether the query should use the http or https protocols. Defaults to http and doesn't introduce a breaking change in behavior. KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT: The port in which the kube-rbac-proxy instance is listening on. You can confirm this by describing your KSM pod. Defaults to 8080 and doesn't introduce a breaking change in behavior. Added: Added 4 new environment variables to explicitly set the control plane component base URLs‚Äã. These variables can be used for Kubernetes configurations, such as OpenShift, that are different than the defaults defined in the section Discovery of master nodes and control plane components. See the section OpenShift 4.x Configuration for more information. SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the scheduler pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration will be used. ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the ETCD pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration will be used. CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the controller manager pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration will be used. API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the API server pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration will be used. Fixed: A bug preventing attributes named like selector.<label_name> from being added to some entries in the K8sServiceSample. Changed: The integration now uses newrelic/infrastructure-bundle as the base image. The tag used is for the version 1.2.0. For more information on this image please see the New Relic Infrastructure Bundle releases notes.",

      "info": "Intro to NerdStorage on New Relic One",
      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Infra/Env/NrjmxBeans - Validates that the mbeans that the user wants to query with the New Relic JMX integration are available for the integration to pull from. This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format. Changes The product will now be known as Diagnostics CLI Diagnostics CLI is proud to announce that is codebase is now part of New Relic's Open Source Community: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli",

      "info": "Use New Relic's Flex integration tool to create a lightweight custom integration that reports event and metric data to New Relic. ",
      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with the New Relic Infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our Infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: New Relic Infrastructure Pro Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses the Infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the Infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the Infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The Infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the Infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

Infra/Env/NrjmxBeans - Validates that the mbeans that the user wants to query with the New Relic JMX integration are available for the integration to pull from. This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format. Changes The product will now be known as Diagnostics CLI Diagnostics CLI is proud to announce that is codebase is now part of New Relic's Open Source Community: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli",

      "info": "Add tags to applications you instrument for easier filtering and organization.",
      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

Infra/Env/NrjmxBeans - Validates that the mbeans that the user wants to query with the New Relic JMX integration are available for the integration to pull from. This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format. Changes The product will now be known as Diagnostics CLI Diagnostics CLI is proud to announce that is codebase is now part of New Relic's Open Source Community: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli",

To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Entity explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Entity explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations. To view the index listing currently open incidents across all products, not just this entity, select View all violations.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)‚Äã‚Äã Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. The default streaming aggregation window duration is 1 minute. The minimum aggregation window is 30 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. Baseline thresholds don't support configurable aggregation window durations. They use the 1 minute default. You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate the streaming algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. If your data is sporadic or has aggregation windows that may not have data, you can fill those gaps with a custom value or the last known value. The default value is None. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Evaluation offset For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. The aggregation window and offset evaluation toggles let you choose how to handle gaps in your streaming alerts data. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the event type data comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. How to edit data gap values: In the NRQL conditions UI under Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with, and then choose None, Last known value, or Custom static value. In the Nerdgraph API (preferred), you'll find this node located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue In the REST API Explorer, you'll see this under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API. Gap filling options: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours.

In 2021, we will be making it easier to create alert NRQL conditions from charts and queries throughout New Relic One. Until that integration is complete, please use the method described below. We'll show an example of how to create an APM external service condition using NRQL. To set up an APM metric condition, it's a two-part process: you first need to identify the entity and then create the NRQL condition. Identify the entity Here's how to get started: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click APM in the toolbar. Find the service you‚Äôd like to alert on. Click on the service. In the left navigation pane, click External services. Under Top 20 external services, find the service you want and click on it.

Dashboards in New Relic embrace the entity concept and are now an entity in New Relic‚Äôs entity ecosystem. Dashboards can now connect with any other type of entity for better observability solutions, which opens the door to endless opportunities we would like you to benefit from. At the same time, we have built new features for dashboards: All New Relic One dashboards are structured in pages, known as Data Apps in Insights Multiple queries from different accounts within the same widget Facet linking Facet linking with support for cases From REST endpoints to GraphQL queries/mutations One of the main benefits from a GraphQL API is that it provides a complete and understandable description of the APIs' data. By using NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic‚Äôs entity ecosystem. You can list all the dashboard entities you have access to: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by name: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by the creator‚Äôs email: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by the creator‚Äôs userId: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type = 'DASHBOARD' and ownerId = \"2357322\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity GUID. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. In the example below we are only interested in the entity GUID and the name of our dashboard. { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid name } } } } Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example below is not complete but can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard GUID and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example is not complete but it can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardUpdate( guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\", dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity GUID. mutation { dashboardDelete { status errors { type description } } } Errors as first class citizens As you might have noticed, all dashboard mutations offer you a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what‚Äôs the source of the problem. mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Original pricing plan This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can‚Äôt be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: you can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it‚Äôs under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it‚Äôll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that‚Äôs determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:‚Äã SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google‚Äôs Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day ‚Äî a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you‚Äôve put in place, you‚Äôll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "info": "Workload status. ",
      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system‚Äôs architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the entity explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it‚Äôs still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don‚Äôt need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven‚Äôt configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren‚Äôt any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input.

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. For more information, check out New Relic University‚Äôs tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

      "body": "For some types of data in New Relic, you can drop (not report) that data. You might want to do this: To filter out unimportant, low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following types of data can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop events meeting certain criteria Let‚Äôs say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don‚Äôt look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

      "body": "Original pricing plan This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can‚Äôt be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: you can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it‚Äôs under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it‚Äôll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that‚Äôs determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "In case you haven‚Äôt heard, NerdGraph is New Relic‚Äôs unified API in a graphQL flavor. The new dashboards API follows this unified approach and is exposed through NerdGraph for user consumption. Why a new dashboards API? Dashboards in New Relic embrace the entity concept and are now an entity in New Relic‚Äôs entity ecosystem. Dashboards can now connect with any other type of entity for better observability solutions, which opens the door to endless opportunities we would like you to benefit from. At the same time, we have built new features for dashboards: All New Relic One dashboards are structured in pages, known as Data Apps in Insights Multiple queries from different accounts within the same widget Facet linking Facet linking with support for cases From REST endpoints to GraphQL queries/mutations One of the main benefits from a GraphQL API is that it provides a complete and understandable description of the APIs' data. By using NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic‚Äôs entity ecosystem. You can list all the dashboard entities you have access to: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by name: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by the creator‚Äôs email: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } You can list all the dashboards by the creator‚Äôs userId: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type = 'DASHBOARD' and ownerId = \"2357322\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity GUID. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. In the example below we are only interested in the entity GUID and the name of our dashboard. { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid name } } } } Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example below is not complete but can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard GUID and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example is not complete but it can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardUpdate( guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\", dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity GUID. mutation { dashboardDelete { status errors { type description } } } Errors as first class citizens As you might have noticed, all dashboard mutations offer you a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what‚Äôs the source of the problem. mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

You might want to do this: To filter out unimportant, low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following types of data can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop events meeting certain criteria Let‚Äôs say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don‚Äôt look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. 1. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } 2. Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } 3. Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google‚Äôs Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day ‚Äî a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you‚Äôve put in place, you‚Äôll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system‚Äôs architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the entity explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it‚Äôs still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don‚Äôt need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven‚Äôt configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren‚Äôt any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key (recommended) or register an Insert API key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Exactly one of: Api-Key or X-License-Key Required Use either your New Relic Insert API key (with Api-Key) or license key (with X-License-Key). Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the application/gzip header. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens.

This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal.

Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. ‚Äã JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"login-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. ‚Äã Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag‚Å† (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example.

Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select Account settings. Select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (aka \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (aka \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, as well as Mobile REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key.

For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key.

Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. REST API key We recommend using a user key to use the REST API because that key has fewer limitations. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For parent accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Availability: Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete [trash can icon] icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the + button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the + button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don‚Äôt need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says ‚ÄúMigrated from an admin user key‚Äù in the key table, so you‚Äôll be able to find them easily.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advance configurations Extend webpack configuration You can use our .extended-webpackrc.js file to extend the webpack 4 configuration. This allows you to add your own aliases, scripts, and configurations when locally serving or deploying your app. Proxy browser setup Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic One. But understanding how this works can help you if you encounter issues (for example, with a proxy or browser setup). When developing, your code is served from your local laptop by using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and will use a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. In order to load third-party code into the platform, (both in development and production), New Relic One uses an <IFRAME>, as well as a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net) to perform the load, relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. For this reason, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where UserId is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform (you can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it). Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where NerdpackUuid is the UUID assigned to your package, and NerdpackGid is zero, or a positive integer (you can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it). Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic‚Äôs built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents.

This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "Legacy feature This document is for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers. Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments.

      "info": "Workload status. ",
      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system‚Äôs architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the entity explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it‚Äôs still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don‚Äôt need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven‚Äôt configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren‚Äôt any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to Applied Intelligence Alerts. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Add a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google‚Äôs Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day ‚Äî a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you‚Äôve put in place, you‚Äôll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

This task is available for Linux and Windows. Infra/Env/ValidateZookeeperPath - Validates that the setting for zookeeper_path (found in kafka-config.yml) is a valid path for the New Relic Kafka integration. Bug fixes Java/Env/Process - This task validates that the New Relic Java agent jar has been correctly added to the -javavagent argument. However, previously, it would only validate those jars that were explicitly named newrelic.jar. We have changed that behavior to look for a jar that could include that version in the filename. Infra/Config/ValidateJMX - The nrdiag-output.json will include information about the Java version and non-sensitive command line arguments for JMX. This data is mainly relevant for Support troubleshooting. Additionally, this health check now can run on Windows. Java/JVM/Permissions - It will not validate permissions for a log path that has been commented out from the Java agent config file. Infra/Config/IntegrationsMatch - This validation will no longer require the presence of on-host integration (OHI) definitions files when the user has an infrastructure agent 1.8.0 or newer and the OHI config file is using the newer configuration format.

      "body": "The preferred way of enabling AWS Lambda monitoring with New Relic is via our Lambda layer. For more information, see Enable serverless monitoring using the Lambda layer. Serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda offers in-depth performance monitoring for your Lambda functions. Read on to learn how to enable this feature and get started using it. How Lambda monitoring works Before enabling Lambda monitoring, understanding how data flows from your Lambda functions to New Relic may be helpful: Diagram showing how data flows from a Lambda function to New Relic. When our Lambda monitoring is enabled, this is how data moves from your Lambda function to New Relic: The Lambda function is instrumented with our code. CloudWatch collects Lambda log data and sends it to our log-ingestion Lambda. The log-ingestion Lambda sends that data to New Relic. Enable procedure overview If you already have a New Relic account and use Node.js or Python, we recommend you use our automated installer. Using this feature may result in AWS charges. See Lambda monitoring requirements.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã If you do not use the automated installer, complete these steps to set up monitoring: Install our CLI tool (recommended) Connect AWS and New Relic (required) Enable instrumentation of your Lambda (required) Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic (required) Step 1. Install the newrelic-lambda-cli tool We provide a command line interface (CLI) tool that's used in steps 2 through 4. We recommend the CLI because it simplifies some of the work, but you can also perform those steps manually. If you want to understand what it does before you install it, see the manual procedures that the CLI tool performs in Step 2, Step 3 (option 2), and Step 4. You can also see the CLI documentation on GitHub. If you prefer a manual install, skip to Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic. CLI requirements To use the CLI too, you need: Python 3.3 or higher The AWS CLI You must be a user or admin with an infrastructure manager Add-on role. Your AWS account needs permissions for creating IAM resources (Role and Policy) and Lambda functions. These resources are created using CloudFormation stacks, so you'll need permissions to create those. For more on permissions, including setting custom policies, expand this collapser: AWS permissions details Resource: * Actions: \"cloudformation:CreateChangeSet\", \"cloudformation:CreateStack\", \"cloudformation:DescribeStacks\", \"cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSets\", \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\", \"iam:CreateRole\", \"iam:GetRole\", \"iam:PassRole\", \"lambda:AddPermission\", \"lambda:CreateFunction\", \"lambda:GetFunction\", \"logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter\", \"logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters\", \"logs:PutSubscriptionFilter\" \"s3:GetObject\" \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet\" Resource: \"arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion\" Actions: \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate\" \"serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate\" Be sure that the AWS account you use to execute the CLI has all of these permissions. If your AWS account permissions are restrictive and you're unable to use the CLI, you can optionally use a manually managed custom IAM policy. This policy would require, at minimum, the following permissions: Resource: \"*\" Action: \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\" \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\" \"cloudwatch:GetMetricData\" \"lambda:GetAccountSettings\" \"lambda:ListFunctions\" \"lambda:ListAliases\" \"lambda:ListTags\" \"lambda:ListEventSourceMappings\" These permissions are the minimum required. We recommend granting a managed ReadOnlyAccess policy as described in Connect AWS to infrastructure monitoring. CLI installation To install the CLI tool: Ensure you have the required permissions for both your New Relic and AWS account. From the command line, run: pip install newrelic-lambda-cli You may need to use pip3 in the command above if you have Python 2.7 installed. The CLI requires Python >=3.3. Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic You must complete this step, and steps 3 and 4, to enable our Lambda monitoring. This step connects AWS to New Relic and creates a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function that sends your instrumented data to New Relic. You can either use the CLI tool or do the steps manually. Use CLI tool When you use the CLI, you have one optional step and one required step: Optional: If you're using multiple AWS profiles or multiple regions, you may want to configure the AWS environment variables: AWS environment variable instructions Setting the region To configure your region, use this environment variable to override the default region: export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=MY_REGION # us-west-2, for example The CLI tool also allows passing this per-command using --aws-region. Setting profiles If you have multiple AWS profiles and don't want to use the default, use AWS_PROFILE environment variable to set another profile name. Ensure the profile is properly configured (including the default region). Example: export AWS_PROFILE=MY_PROFILE Run the following command using the CLI tool: newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --linked-account-name YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME \\ --nr-api-key YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY This command: Connects your AWS account to New Relic. Installs a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda that will send your instrumented data to New Relic. More details: This defaults to U.S. region. If your account is in the EU region, add this argument: --nr-region \"eu\". If you're instrumenting functions in multiple AWS regions, this command must be run for each region using the --aws-region argument. YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME is either a new AWS account you want to link to New Relic, or it's the name of the AWS account that you linked to when setting up the AWS Lambda monitoring integration. YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY refers to your user key (not your REST API key). For more on the API key and other arguments, see our Lambda monitoring GitHub repo. Manual procedures Here are the manual procedures performed by the CLI tool: Connect AWS to New Relic The newrelic-lambda integration command connects the AWS account containing your Lambdas to New Relic. If you've already installed one of our AWS integrations, your accounts should be linked to New Relic and you can skip this section. To manually establish this connection, follow the instructions for connecting AWS to Infrastructure monitoring. Configure our log-ingestion Lambda The newrelic-lambda integration command sets up a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. This Lambda takes the logs generated by your Lambda functions and pushes those logs to New Relic. If you're configuring this manually, you must configure our Lambda for the regions you want. The CLI, by default, establishes our Lambda in all regions. To manually configure our Lambda, go to the AWS Serverless Application Repository, which is where the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda is stored. This repo is a collection of serverless applications published by developers, companies, and partners in the serverless community. It allows developers to share their Lambda functions code with customers, who can then find and deploy the corresponding application Lambda function. Each application is packaged with an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template that defines the AWS resources used. To manually configure our Lambda with the AWS Serverless Application Repository: From the AWS console, go to the Lambda section, select Create function, and select Serverless Application Repository. Search for newrelic and find the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. Follow the instructions in the Lambda's documentation to deploy it. A SAM template will build the Lambda. In the environment variable section in AWS console, set the LICENSE_KEY environment variable to your New Relic license key. Note: If you have multiple accounts or a master and sub-account hierarchy, make sure the license key you're using matches the same account connected to AWS. Optional: If you want to stream all your logs to New Relic, set the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable to true. For more on this, see Stream all logs. Step 3. Enable Lambda instrumentation This step enables instrumentation of your Lambda function, which allows detailed monitoring and alerting functionality. Our instrumentation is designed to have minimal impact on your Lambda performance. If you're using Node.js or Python, we recommend the first two options. Option #1: Use Serverless Framework plugin (Node.js and Python) Requirements Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. Serverless Framework version 1.34.0 or higher. Features If you meet the requirements (above), you can use our Serverless Framework plugin, which allows you to add our AWS Lambda Layer to your functions without requiring a code change. Supports Node.js and Python runtimes No code change required to enable Lambda instrumentation Enables our APM agent functionality using a single layer Configures CloudWatch subscription filters automatically Gets the layer into your code base which is useful for redeploys Install To install our Serverless Framework plugin: Choose an install option: NPM: npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers yarn: yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Add the plugin to your serverless.yml: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Get your account ID and put it in the serverless.yml: custom: newRelic: accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Deploy it: sls deploy You can skip Step 4. Setting up CloudWatch Logs. This is automatically completed on deploy by our Serverless Framework plugin. For the next step, go to What's next? Option #2: Add Lambda Layer with our CLI (Node.js and Python) Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. If you don‚Äôt have Serverless Framework and don't intend to redeploy your function frequently, you can use the CLI to add our Lambda Layer: If you haven't already done so, install the CLI: pip install newrelic-lambda-cli List available functions: newrelic-lambda functions list Pass the option -f not-installed to see which functions have not yet been instrumented. Add the layer to your function: newrelic-lambda layers install --function FUNCTION_NAME --nr-account-id NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID Next, you will configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic. Option #3: Manually add our Lambda Layer (Node.js and Python) Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see Manual instrumentation. If you don‚Äôt have Serverless Framework, you can manually add our Lambda Layer: Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your functions handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. If you have Node 8 and get a Lambda can't find file error message, expand this collapser: Node 8 \"can't find file\" error troubleshooting If you have Node 8 and receive a Lambda can't find the file newrelic-lambda-wrapper.js message, it's likely that the Node runtime isn't resolving NPM_PATH for the newrelic-lambda module in /opt/nodejs/node_modules. These steps should fix this problem: Create a newrelic-wrapper-helper.js script in your project's root. The script's contents should be module.exports = require('newrelic-lambda-wrapper');. (That is all that needs to be in that script.) Update the handler for your layer declaration to newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler. Next, you will configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic. Option #4: Manually instrument Lambda code for Go, Java, .NET Core, Node.js, and Python If none of the previous options work for you, you can manually instrument your Lambda code. Choose your language: Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda. Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project‚Äôs build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public override Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // This call will block by calling task.Result Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‚ÄòMyEventType‚Äô, {foo: ‚Äòbar‚Äô}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) ‚Ä¶ Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Step 4. Configure CloudWatch logs to stream to New Relic Lambda In this step, you'll link your Lambda function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda that was configured in Step 2. For Node.js and Python: This step isn't necessary if you used the Serverless Framework plugin option in Step 3. This step can be done using the CLI tool or using manual procedures. Use CLI tool Run this command for every Lambda function you want to monitor: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function FUNCTION_NAME_#1 Or to set subscription filters for all supported functions run this command:: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function all Notes on this command: You should only need one newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda per AWS account and region. You can subscribe as many functions to it as you like. To see more detail about the arguments, including a region-specifying argument, see our GitHub documentation. You may receive a CloudWatch validation error. This doesn't affect data reporting. If you see data reporting in New Relic, disregard that error message. If you have our Logs and want to send all your log data to us (not just Lambda logs), see Stream all logs. Manual procedures Here are the manual procedures performed by the CLI tool: Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda In Step 2, you set up a newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function. After you've instrumented your Lambda function (Step 3), the newrelic-lambda subscriptions command links that function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. To do this manually: Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting. Use configuration settings to fine-tune your data. Our newrelic-log-ingestion function is not updated automatically. For best results and access to latest features, we recommend you occasionally update our Lambda monitoring. Optional: Stream all logs to New Relic If you have log management enabled and want to report all your logs to New Relic, follow these instructions: Go to our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda and set the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable to true. It isn't possible to edit existing filter patterns, so they must be removed and re-added: Set the Subscription filter pattern to \"\". Go to the Log group for each monitored Lambda, and remove the newrelic-log-ingestion subscription. Add the subscription filter back, leaving the Subscription filter pattern field blank.

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors‚Äîand more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it‚Äôs a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span‚Äôs duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. To use Incident Intelligence and Applied Intelligence, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. How it works After you set up Incident Intelligence, our system will begin finding issues from your data sources. In the issue feed, you can find an overview of all your issues, along with helpful information about them. You can also click any individual issue for more detail, including its analysis summary, event log, and details about correlated issues. This screenshot shows an example issue feed, which describes your issues' statuses, correlations, and more. What's the difference between an issue, incident, and event? In short, these terms are like building blocks. Events are raw data from your sources. Incidents are made up of one or more events. Issues are composed of one or more incidents. In more detail: Events indicate a state change or trigger defined by your monitoring systems. An event contains information about the affected entity, and they are almost always triggered automatically by the system. Incidents are groups of events that describe the \"symptoms\" of your system over time. These symptoms are detected by your monitoring tools, which evaluate your data streams and events. Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these four steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges.‚Äã Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per master account and its sub-accounts.‚Äã More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one master account. Need to change the environment's associated account? Reach out to your account executive or our support team for help. Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Go to Incident Intelligence. Click Sources and then choose New Relic Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. PagerDuty You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Go to Incident Intelligence. Click Sources and then choose PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Sources, then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Sources, then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Sources, then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Sources, then click ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãAmazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. 3. Configure destinations Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. You can set destinations using any of the following methods: Send data to PagerDuty Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Send data to ServiceNow Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. Visual timeline The visual timeline, as presented below, shows you a breakdown of: Incidents The trends taking place What incidents are active What incidents are resolved What is correlated to each other Various milestones at different issue levels In addition, you‚Äôll see a grey line at the top of the timeline. In comparison to the visual timeline that shows the changes to each incident, the grey line represents changes to the issue. Mouse over the grey line to see details of the event. Finally, mouse over the incident to see information on the location, timing, and level of importance of a specific incident. This figure shows a particular incident populated on January 11th with a level of Critical. To view the issues in a text format, in the right hand corner, click Switch to issue log view. Related activity The related activity section aggregates a set of incidents into a single issue, according to a rule-based system. This section will show you the Last Update, the Source location, its State, the number of Related Events, and where it Originated. You can also copy the Payload or click on Analyze for more information. Issue summary The issue page is built to first provide the user with bottom line insights to understand the problem and minimize the time needed to resolve it. The following outlines each of the four sections on the issue page: The Analysis Summary: the analysis summary has two machine learning modules, the golden signals and the related components. The Suggested Responder: the suggested responder will tell you who to potentially reach out to on your team to solve a specific problem. The Impacted Entities: an entity is anything that has data you can monitor. Specifically, these are focused on incidents from New Relic sources, extracting the entities and providing a summary. Each entity is unique. The Label Sets: label sets are focused on incidents that come from 3rd party sources, such as PagerDuty, AWS Cloudwatch, REST APIs, etc., as well as for NRQL queries. They come in the form of key:value pairs. All four of these sections can show up together for each issue or separately. It will vary based on the data in the issue. In addition to these four sections, you can also take a look at anomaly overview and entity overview directly from the issue feed. If you hover over an impacted entity application, you‚Äôll notice both call to actions: anomaly overview and entity overview. Anomaly overview will open the application's anomalies page. This is only available for applications that are set up for Proactive Detection. Finally, the issue page contains deployment events. APM‚Äôs Deployment page lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. This section will only show up if New Relic has identified applications under the Impacted Entities that have deployments. There are two types of deployment events: deployments and related deployments. Click ‚ÄúShow all deployments‚Äù, to see all your deployment events when they arrive. Click a specific deployment to see its APM deployments page. Use decisions To further reduce noise or get improved incident correlation, you can change or customize your decisions. Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence groups incidents together. To get started, see Decisions. Use suggested responders If you‚Äôre using PagerDuty or New Relic alerts violations as your incident notification tools, Incident Intelligence suggests relevant team members that can help resolve your issues. Incident Intelligence learns from your PagerDuty and alerts violations data to provide suggestions for each new incident. Once you receive a suggestion, you can contact the responder or search for relevant documentation that person may have written. To get started, enable PagerDuty or alerts violations as a source for Incident Intelligence. Afterwards, you can view the suggestions in two places: The issue feed, where you can also provide feedback‚Äã on the suggestions. Directly within PagerDuty (both UI and API.) If you‚Äôre also using PagerDuty as a destination, the suggestions will appear in your issue notifications payload. This feature doesn't account for on-call availability at the time of incident. In order to train the model, we use the information PagerDuty provides about individuals. We ingest incident information only, not users‚Äô contact details. EU and US datacenter and Incident Intelligence data New Relic's Incident Intelligence service is performed solely in the United States. By using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our EU region data center. If you elect to use the Suggested Responder feature and manage EU-based individuals, you may need to confirm that an appropriate data processing agreement is in place.

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In 2021, we will be making it easier to create alert NRQL conditions from charts and queries throughout New Relic One. Until that integration is complete, please use the method described below. We'll show an example of how to create an APM external service condition using NRQL. To set up an APM metric condition, it's a two-part process: you first need to identify the entity and then create the NRQL condition. Identify the entity Here's how to get started: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click APM in the toolbar. Find the service you‚Äôd like to alert on. Click on the service. In the left navigation pane, click External services. Under Top 20 external services, find the service you want and click on it. On the right side of the page, where you see graphs for Response time and External calls per minute (throughput), decide which of these two options you would like to alert on. In the upper-right corner of the graph you choose, click the three dots, and select View query. If you don‚Äôt see these three dots, ensure the Show new view option at the top of the page is enabled. Copy the query to your clipboard. If you choose response time, your query may look like this: If you choose external calls per minute, your query may look like this: When your query is on the clipboard, continue to the next section to create the NRQL alert condition. Create the NRQL condition After you generate the query, complete the following: Navigate to the alert's policy where you‚Äôd like to create this condition. Click Add a condition, select the NRQL tab, and click Next, define thresholds... In Define your signal, paste the query from your clipboard. Remove any LIMIT, SINCE...AGO, and TIMESERIES clauses. These must be removed for the NRQL query syntax to be valid. If no results are returned, ensure you are in the correct account using the account dropdown in the upper-left corner. Fill out the remaining fields and save your condition. See our additional information about querying APM metric timeslice data with NRQL.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:‚Äã SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... SELECT function(attribute) ... The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 1:00 through 3:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO ‚Äã‚ÄãThis query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn‚Äôt support its use or that hasn‚Äôt used sampled data, it has no effect. Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Query metric data There are several ways to query metric data using NRQL: Query metric timeslice data, which is reported by New Relic APM, Mobile, Browser Query the Metric data type, which is reported by some of our integrations and Telemetry SDKs For more on understanding metrics in New Relic, see Metric data types. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Here are the available aggregator functions. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour‚Äôs worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]‚Äã) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT unique(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.
