This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "Explore NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, and build the queries you need.",
      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don‚Äôt have Zipkin-format data, you‚Äôd use this) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ > -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"common\": { $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" $ } $ }, $ \"spans\": [ $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"ABC\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"duration.ms\": 12.53, $ \"name\": \"/home\" $ } $ }, $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"DEF\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", $ \"duration.ms\": 2.97, $ \"name\": \"/auth\", $ \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"metrics\": [ $ { $ \"name\": \"memory.heap\", $ \"type\": \"gauge\", $ \"value\": 2.3, $ \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, $ \"attributes\": { $ \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"customerId\": \"xyz\" $ } $ ]' Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don‚Äôt meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ \"logs\": [ $ { $ \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, $ \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" $ } $ ] $ ]'",

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent.

Related documentation: Add custom attributes to existing events Send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM) Custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Data considerations The New Relic agents sends event data to New Relic as part of its normal harvest cycle every 5 seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. For more information, check out New Relic University‚Äôs tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record a custom event To record a custom event, follow the procedure for your New Relic language agent: C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml:‚Äã custom_insights_events: enabled: false For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy.

Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This section of the docs provides examples and reference documentation for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. New Relic provides a powerful GraphQL tool to explore the API with embedded schema definitions. To get started, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For sample queries and mutations, use our NerdGraph tutorials. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings.

Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. If you implemented the REST API for querying subscription usage data prior to July 10, 2018, those usage-related REST APIs are now deprecated. You should use the Query API, which requires creating an API key. For more on switching to the new API format, see the transition guide. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights API resources for Insights include: Resource Details Insert events API To report custom data use the Event insertion API. Query API To query your Insights data using NRQL-formatted queries, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Dashboard API To create, read, update, and delete dashboards, use the Dashboard API. Other New Relic product APIs You can also report custom data from other New Relic features. For more information, see the API sections for other products. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query data with NRQL. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

The agent now reports the gRPC status code rather than \"translating\" to HTTP status codes. Vert.x The Java agent now provides visibility into your applications built using the Vert.x 3.8. The agent instruments Vert.x Web, Vert.x Core, and Vert.x HTTP client. With this instrumentation, the agent will identify and name your transactions based on Vert.x web routing paths. The agent will also time web handlers, track async handlers, and external calls made with Vert.x HTTP client. XML custom instrumentation The custom XML instrumentation XSD has been enhanced to support now include support for specifying leaf tracers. Class Histogram A new Class Histogram extension is now available to report heap memory details as events. Jedis Added support for Jedis 3.0.0 and higher. You can now see your Jedis calls in breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. Lettuce Instrumentation modules for Lettuce 4 and 5 are now available via the Java agent incubator. New OSS SDK We now have an open source Telemetry SDK for Java for sending telemetry data to New Relic. The current SDK supports sending dimensional metrics to the Metric API and spans to the Trace API. Fixes The Solr 7 instrumentation would not report Update JMX metrics.

      "info": "Learn the essentials of the New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage.",
      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag‚Å† (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to: Organize all your entities efficiently. Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what. Easily find dashboards that visualize the entities or data you care about. Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. Learn more. Add, edit, and manage tags You can create and manage tags with New Relic NerdGraph. Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in New Relic One. If you're already familiar with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, see the following tutorials for sample queries: Manage tags: add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities Query entities: search for and see relationships between entities View tags and metadata for an entity After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways: UI: From the entity explorer, select an entity from the index. On the Summary page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID. API: Use NerdGraph to read the existing tags for an entity. After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as: Chart builder NerdGraph NRQL REST API Metadata descriptions and examples Metadata Description Account ID The New Relic account ID associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data. For example, if you know the Account ID, you can: Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account Account name The New Relic account name associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account. For example, you can use the Account name in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account. Agent version APM only The language agent version currently installed for this application. (If you want to check whether you have the most up-to-date version, see the specific agent's release notes.) App ID, Browser ID, Mobile ID The New Relic application ID for the specific type of entity. Entity GUID The globally unique identifier for a specific entity in New Relic. Also referred to as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Language agent APM only For APM agent's programming language. Specific language agents may offer additional features to view in the New Relic UI or to query your data. Tagging examples You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways: Use case Tags to use Form entities into logical groups Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI. Indicate ownership of the entity Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team. Rank entities by criticality Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones. Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers. Indicate facts about the entity Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running. Formatting and parameters When using tags, be aware of the following parameters: An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value. A key can have a maximum of 128 characters. A value can have a maximum of 256 characters. If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like key-name, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `key-name` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus. Use tags in New Relic One one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI. After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about. To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the Filter field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to. Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems. Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors In the APM agent configuration file settings, the labels field is used to add tags to your application data. If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Entity explorer. In the Filter with tags field, enter your APM or Synthetics label. Filter by infrastructure attributes If you use attributes with infrastructure monitoring, our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI. Examples of default tags created for a host include: hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net operatingsystem:linux agentversion:1.1.7 Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply team:my-team as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed. For more help",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you‚Äôll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it‚Äôs feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose.

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application‚Äôs ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application‚Äôs index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application‚Äôs ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you‚Äôve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to: Organize all your entities efficiently. Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what. Easily find dashboards that visualize the entities or data you care about. Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. Learn more. Add, edit, and manage tags You can create and manage tags with New Relic NerdGraph. Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in New Relic One. If you're already familiar with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, see the following tutorials for sample queries: Manage tags: add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities Query entities: search for and see relationships between entities View tags and metadata for an entity After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways: UI: From the entity explorer, select an entity from the index. On the Summary page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID. API: Use NerdGraph to read the existing tags for an entity. After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as: Chart builder NerdGraph NRQL REST API Metadata descriptions and examples Metadata Description Account ID The New Relic account ID associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data. For example, if you know the Account ID, you can: Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account Account name The New Relic account name associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account. For example, you can use the Account name in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account. Agent version APM only The language agent version currently installed for this application. (If you want to check whether you have the most up-to-date version, see the specific agent's release notes.) App ID, Browser ID, Mobile ID The New Relic application ID for the specific type of entity. Entity GUID The globally unique identifier for a specific entity in New Relic. Also referred to as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Language agent APM only For APM agent's programming language. Specific language agents may offer additional features to view in the New Relic UI or to query your data. Tagging examples You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways: Use case Tags to use Form entities into logical groups Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI. Indicate ownership of the entity Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team. Rank entities by criticality Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones. Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers. Indicate facts about the entity Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running. Formatting and parameters When using tags, be aware of the following parameters: An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value. A key can have a maximum of 128 characters. A value can have a maximum of 256 characters. If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like key-name, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `key-name` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus. Use tags in New Relic One one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI. After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about. To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the Filter field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to. Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems. Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors In the APM agent configuration file settings, the labels field is used to add tags to your application data. If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Entity explorer. In the Filter with tags field, enter your APM or Synthetics label. Filter by infrastructure attributes If you use attributes with infrastructure monitoring, our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI. Examples of default tags created for a host include: hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net operatingsystem:linux agentversion:1.1.7 Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply team:my-team as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed.

      "body": "A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to: Organize all your entities efficiently. Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what. Easily find dashboards that visualize the entities or data you care about. Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. Learn more. Add, edit, and manage tags You can create and manage tags with New Relic NerdGraph. Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in New Relic One. If you're already familiar with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, see the following tutorials for sample queries: Manage tags: add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities Query entities: search for and see relationships between entities View tags and metadata for an entity After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways: UI: From the entity explorer, select an entity from the index. On the Summary page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID. API: Use NerdGraph to read the existing tags for an entity. After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as: Chart builder NerdGraph NRQL REST API Metadata descriptions and examples Metadata Description Account ID The New Relic account ID associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data. For example, if you know the Account ID, you can: Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account Account name The New Relic account name associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account. For example, you can use the Account name in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account. Agent version APM only The language agent version currently installed for this application. (If you want to check whether you have the most up-to-date version, see the specific agent's release notes.) App ID, Browser ID, Mobile ID The New Relic application ID for the specific type of entity. Entity GUID The globally unique identifier for a specific entity in New Relic. Also referred to as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Language agent APM only For APM agent's programming language. Specific language agents may offer additional features to view in the New Relic UI or to query your data. Tagging examples You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways: Use case Tags to use Form entities into logical groups Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI. Indicate ownership of the entity Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team. Rank entities by criticality Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones. Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers. Indicate facts about the entity Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running. Formatting and parameters When using tags, be aware of the following parameters: An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value. A key can have a maximum of 128 characters. A value can have a maximum of 256 characters. If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like key-name, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `key-name` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus. Use tags in New Relic One one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI. After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about. To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the Filter field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to. Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems. Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors In the APM agent configuration file settings, the labels field is used to add tags to your application data. If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Entity explorer. In the Filter with tags field, enter your APM or Synthetics label. Filter by infrastructure attributes If you use attributes with infrastructure monitoring, our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI. Examples of default tags created for a host include: hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net operatingsystem:linux agentversion:1.1.7 Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply team:my-team as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed. For more help",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic One CLI Nerdpack commands To set up your Nerdpacks, use the commands below. You can click any command to see its usage options and additional details about the command. Command Description nr1 nerdpack:build Assembles your Nerdpack into bundles nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:clean Cleans your development folders. nr1 nerdpack:validate Validates the contents of your Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your Nerdpack in the New Relic's registry. Command details nr1 nerdpack:build Builds a Nerdpack Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and CSS bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:build OPTION Options --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specify a json file path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=prerelease If specififed, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile The authencation profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to undeploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Cleans and removes the content and the developtment folders (dist/, tmp/).

On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\" } ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Fetch a single secret query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters. Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as writing, deleting, and fetching data, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally.

It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix.

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can see it directly on their homepage.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Permissions for managing applications When you create an app, you'll likely want to share it. From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they‚Äôve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren‚Äôt an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1.

Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks.

      "body": "Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite 15 min Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds‚Äîor 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time‚Äîless than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company, and simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker Cloning the demo-deployer Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the deployer's repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When it finishes, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Automate tagging of your entire stack 30 min Organizing your services, hosts, and applications in New Relic can be challenging, especially as resources come and go. One strategy to overcome this challenge is to apply tags, consistently, across your stack. In this guide, you: Provision a host on AWS Deploy a small Node.js app on that host Instrument the host and the application with New Relic agents Apply consistent tags across all your entities Tear down everything you make when you're done The next section introduces you to tools for performing tasks in this guide. Before you begin Throughout this guide, you use three open source projects to automatically set up, instrument, and tear down your infrastructure: Demo Deployer: The engine that drives the automation Demo Nodetron: A Node.js app that you run on your host. It presents a web page and an API, which you use to generate traffic. Demo New Relic Instrumentation: A project that instruments your host and application Each project is distinct, and encapsulates its own behavior. This maintains a separation of concerns and allows you to compose complex scenarios using a modular approach. Collaborate with us The Demo Deployer is currently in development. Because of our commitment to open source, we are working in the open early in the process and invite you to collaborate with us. Drop any thoughts and comments in the Build on New Relic support thread, and let us know what you think! The last thing you need before you get started is to install Docker if you don't have it already. Now that you have a high-level understanding of the tools you'll use, you can begin by building the Demo Deployer! Step 1 of 6 Build the deployer To use the deployer, first clone its repository from GitHub. Then, build a Docker image using the local copy of the code. First, clone the repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer.git Second, build the deployer Docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t deployer demo-deployer Now, you have a Docker image, named deployer, which you use throughout the rest of this guide. Step 2 of 6 Configure your credentials In this guide, you provision a host on AWS. The deployer uses a configuration file that contains your credentials for each service it communicates with so that it can invoke the necessary APIs. You can follow the User Config documentation in the deployer repository to set up each account and create your configuration file. In the end, you'll have a JSON file that contains credentials for AWS, New Relic, and GitHub: { \"credentials\": { \"aws\": { \"apiKey\": \"my_aws_api_key\", \"secretKey\": \"my_aws_secret_key\", \"secretKeyPath\": \"/path/to/my/secretkey.pem\", \"region\": \"my_aws_region\" }, \"newrelic\": { \"licenseKey\": \"my_new_relic_license_key\", \"accountId\": \"my_new_relic_account_id\" }, \"git\": { \"username\": \"my_git_access_token\" } } } Copy Name the credentials file creds.json, and store it‚Äîalong with your [keypair filename].pem file‚Äîin a directory called $HOME/configs. Step 3 of 6 Run the application Now that everything is set up, you can run the deployer application in a Docker container: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json With this command, you're running the deployer Docker container with the following options: -v mounts the $HOME/configs volume (where you stored your configuration files) at /mnt/deployer/configs/ in the container --entrypoint sets the default command for Docker to ruby Finally, you pass a list of arguments to the entrypoint, including: -c configs/creds.json: The user credentials configuration file -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json: The deployment configuration file Tip You can specify the log level for the deployer using -l. info is the default, but you can also use debug or error. This is a helpful option to use when something goes wrong. Once you run this command, the deployer will create and instrument some specific resources. This may take a few minutes. In the meantime, read on to learn more about what is actually happening during this process. Locating the user configuration files Notice, in the Docker command, that -c takes configs/creds.json. Also, you referenced your .pem file from configs/, as well. This is because you mounted $HOME/configs to /mnt/deployer/configs/ and /mnt/deployer/ is the working directory, according to the deployer's Dockerfile. So, you can access your user configuration files at configs/, which is a relative path from your working directory. Understanding the deployment configuration file The deployment configuration file, hello.json, which drives the deployer, contains four sections: services global_tags resources instrumentations These sections describe the actions the deployer executes. The first section is services: { \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"app1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-App1\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"port\": 5001, \"destinations\": [\"host1\"], \"files\": [ { \"destination_filepath\": \"engine/data/index.json\", \"content\": <some content> } ] } ] } Copy services defines one service, app1, which lives on host1 at port 5001. It uses the Demo Nodetron you learned about earlier in this guide as its source. Important In this example, some HTML has been removed for clarity. To run the deployer, you need to use the real content in hello.json. The second section is global_tags: { \"global_tags\": { \"dxOwningTeam\": \"DemoX\", \"dxEnvironment\": \"development\", \"dxDepartment\": \"Area51\", \"dxProduct\": \"Hello\" } } Copy global_tags defines tags for the deployer to apply to all the resources in your stack. These tags are an important part of organizing your New Relic entities. The third section is resources: { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"host1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-Host1\", \"provider\": \"aws\", \"type\": \"ec2\", \"size\": \"t3.micro\" } ] } Copy resources defines one host, host1, which is a small EC2 instance on AWS. This host is referred to in the services section. The fourth, and final, section is instrumentations: { \"instrumentations\": { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_infra\", \"resource_ids\": [\"host1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"1.12.1\" } ], \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_node_agent\", \"service_ids\": [\"app1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/node/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"6.11.0\" } ] } } Copy instrumentations configures, as the name implies, New Relic instrumentations for the host1 infrastructure and the app1 Node.js application. These definitions use the Demo New Relic Instrumentation project you learned about earlier. Step 4 of 6 Generate some traffic When deployer has run successfully, you will see a message that describes the resources deployed and services installed during the process: bash [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful! Deployed Resources: host1 (aws/ec2): ip: 52.90.86.109 services: [\"app1\"] instrumentation: nr_infra: newrelic v1.12.1 Installed Services: app1: url: http://52.90.86.109:5001 instrumentation: nr_node_agent: newrelic v6.11.0 Completed at 2020-08-20 15:11:14 +0000 Visit your application by navigating to the app1 url in your browser: From there, you can follow the instructions to send traffic to New Relic. Important Your app1 url will be different than the url shown in this guide. Step 5 of 6 Check your tags After you've generated some traffic to your Node.js application, use the New Relic search redirect to find the resources you deployed: Once you have found your resources, select the service you deployed, Hello-App1. Then, click on the 'i' icon next to the name, which opens the metadata and tags modal: Notice that all the tags in the global_tags section of the deployment configuration show up under Tags: If you open the metadata modal for the host, you'll also see the global_tags. Step 6 of 6 Tear down your resources Because you've provisioned resources in your cloud account, you need to decommission them. You can do this with the deployer. Add the teardown flag, -t, to the end of your command: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json -t When the deployer has finished successfully, you'll see output that is similar to what you saw during deployment: bash [INFO] Executing Teardown [‚úî] Parsing and validating Teardown configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Uninstalling On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Uninstalling Services and instrumentations success [‚úî] Terminating infrastructure success [INFO] Teardown successful! Next steps Congratulations! Throughout this guide, you used the Demo Deployer to provision and instrument a host and application in AWS and automatically configured those entities with a list of tags. Next, try creating your own deployment configuration and change the global tags! One cool thing you can do is pass in a configuration file URL to the deployer. Here's one that uses a gist on GitHub: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markweitzel/d281fde8ca572ced6346dc25470790a5/raw/373166eb50929a0dd23ba5136abf2fa5caf3d369/MarksHelloDemoConfig.json",

      "body": "Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite 15 min Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds‚Äîor 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time‚Äîless than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Diagnose error alerts in Telco Lite 20 min Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Automate tagging of your entire stack 30 min Organizing your services, hosts, and applications in New Relic can be challenging, especially as resources come and go. One strategy to overcome this challenge is to apply tags, consistently, across your stack. In this guide, you: Provision a host on AWS Deploy a small Node.js app on that host Instrument the host and the application with New Relic agents Apply consistent tags across all your entities Tear down everything you make when you're done The next section introduces you to tools for performing tasks in this guide. Before you begin Throughout this guide, you use three open source projects to automatically set up, instrument, and tear down your infrastructure: Demo Deployer: The engine that drives the automation Demo Nodetron: A Node.js app that you run on your host. It presents a web page and an API, which you use to generate traffic. Demo New Relic Instrumentation: A project that instruments your host and application Each project is distinct, and encapsulates its own behavior. This maintains a separation of concerns and allows you to compose complex scenarios using a modular approach. Collaborate with us The Demo Deployer is currently in development. Because of our commitment to open source, we are working in the open early in the process and invite you to collaborate with us. Drop any thoughts and comments in the Build on New Relic support thread, and let us know what you think! The last thing you need before you get started is to install Docker if you don't have it already. Now that you have a high-level understanding of the tools you'll use, you can begin by building the Demo Deployer! Step 1 of 6 Build the deployer To use the deployer, first clone its repository from GitHub. Then, build a Docker image using the local copy of the code. First, clone the repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer.git Second, build the deployer Docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t deployer demo-deployer Now, you have a Docker image, named deployer, which you use throughout the rest of this guide. Step 2 of 6 Configure your credentials In this guide, you provision a host on AWS. The deployer uses a configuration file that contains your credentials for each service it communicates with so that it can invoke the necessary APIs. You can follow the User Config documentation in the deployer repository to set up each account and create your configuration file. In the end, you'll have a JSON file that contains credentials for AWS, New Relic, and GitHub: { \"credentials\": { \"aws\": { \"apiKey\": \"my_aws_api_key\", \"secretKey\": \"my_aws_secret_key\", \"secretKeyPath\": \"/path/to/my/secretkey.pem\", \"region\": \"my_aws_region\" }, \"newrelic\": { \"licenseKey\": \"my_new_relic_license_key\", \"accountId\": \"my_new_relic_account_id\" }, \"git\": { \"username\": \"my_git_access_token\" } } } Copy Name the credentials file creds.json, and store it‚Äîalong with your [keypair filename].pem file‚Äîin a directory called $HOME/configs. Step 3 of 6 Run the application Now that everything is set up, you can run the deployer application in a Docker container: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json With this command, you're running the deployer Docker container with the following options: -v mounts the $HOME/configs volume (where you stored your configuration files) at /mnt/deployer/configs/ in the container --entrypoint sets the default command for Docker to ruby Finally, you pass a list of arguments to the entrypoint, including: -c configs/creds.json: The user credentials configuration file -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json: The deployment configuration file Tip You can specify the log level for the deployer using -l. info is the default, but you can also use debug or error. This is a helpful option to use when something goes wrong. Once you run this command, the deployer will create and instrument some specific resources. This may take a few minutes. In the meantime, read on to learn more about what is actually happening during this process. Locating the user configuration files Notice, in the Docker command, that -c takes configs/creds.json. Also, you referenced your .pem file from configs/, as well. This is because you mounted $HOME/configs to /mnt/deployer/configs/ and /mnt/deployer/ is the working directory, according to the deployer's Dockerfile. So, you can access your user configuration files at configs/, which is a relative path from your working directory. Understanding the deployment configuration file The deployment configuration file, hello.json, which drives the deployer, contains four sections: services global_tags resources instrumentations These sections describe the actions the deployer executes. The first section is services: { \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"app1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-App1\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"port\": 5001, \"destinations\": [\"host1\"], \"files\": [ { \"destination_filepath\": \"engine/data/index.json\", \"content\": <some content> } ] } ] } Copy services defines one service, app1, which lives on host1 at port 5001. It uses the Demo Nodetron you learned about earlier in this guide as its source. Important In this example, some HTML has been removed for clarity. To run the deployer, you need to use the real content in hello.json. The second section is global_tags: { \"global_tags\": { \"dxOwningTeam\": \"DemoX\", \"dxEnvironment\": \"development\", \"dxDepartment\": \"Area51\", \"dxProduct\": \"Hello\" } } Copy global_tags defines tags for the deployer to apply to all the resources in your stack. These tags are an important part of organizing your New Relic entities. The third section is resources: { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"host1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-Host1\", \"provider\": \"aws\", \"type\": \"ec2\", \"size\": \"t3.micro\" } ] } Copy resources defines one host, host1, which is a small EC2 instance on AWS. This host is referred to in the services section. The fourth, and final, section is instrumentations: { \"instrumentations\": { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_infra\", \"resource_ids\": [\"host1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"1.12.1\" } ], \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_node_agent\", \"service_ids\": [\"app1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/node/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"6.11.0\" } ] } } Copy instrumentations configures, as the name implies, New Relic instrumentations for the host1 infrastructure and the app1 Node.js application. These definitions use the Demo New Relic Instrumentation project you learned about earlier. Step 4 of 6 Generate some traffic When deployer has run successfully, you will see a message that describes the resources deployed and services installed during the process: bash [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful! Deployed Resources: host1 (aws/ec2): ip: 52.90.86.109 services: [\"app1\"] instrumentation: nr_infra: newrelic v1.12.1 Installed Services: app1: url: http://52.90.86.109:5001 instrumentation: nr_node_agent: newrelic v6.11.0 Completed at 2020-08-20 15:11:14 +0000 Visit your application by navigating to the app1 url in your browser: From there, you can follow the instructions to send traffic to New Relic. Important Your app1 url will be different than the url shown in this guide. Step 5 of 6 Check your tags After you've generated some traffic to your Node.js application, use the New Relic search redirect to find the resources you deployed: Once you have found your resources, select the service you deployed, Hello-App1. Then, click on the 'i' icon next to the name, which opens the metadata and tags modal: Notice that all the tags in the global_tags section of the deployment configuration show up under Tags: If you open the metadata modal for the host, you'll also see the global_tags. Step 6 of 6 Tear down your resources Because you've provisioned resources in your cloud account, you need to decommission them. You can do this with the deployer. Add the teardown flag, -t, to the end of your command: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json -t When the deployer has finished successfully, you'll see output that is similar to what you saw during deployment: bash [INFO] Executing Teardown [‚úî] Parsing and validating Teardown configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Uninstalling On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Uninstalling Services and instrumentations success [‚úî] Terminating infrastructure success [INFO] Teardown successful! Next steps Congratulations! Throughout this guide, you used the Demo Deployer to provision and instrument a host and application in AWS and automatically configured those entities with a list of tags. Next, try creating your own deployment configuration and change the global tags! One cool thing you can do is pass in a configuration file URL to the deployer. Here's one that uses a gist on GitHub: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markweitzel/d281fde8ca572ced6346dc25470790a5/raw/373166eb50929a0dd23ba5136abf2fa5caf3d369/MarksHelloDemoConfig.json",

      "body": "Practice diagnosing common issues using New Relic 75 min Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company, and simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker Cloning the demo-deployer Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the deployer's repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When it finishes, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Diagnose error alerts in Telco Lite 20 min Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Automate tagging of your entire stack 30 min Organizing your services, hosts, and applications in New Relic can be challenging, especially as resources come and go. One strategy to overcome this challenge is to apply tags, consistently, across your stack. In this guide, you: Provision a host on AWS Deploy a small Node.js app on that host Instrument the host and the application with New Relic agents Apply consistent tags across all your entities Tear down everything you make when you're done The next section introduces you to tools for performing tasks in this guide. Before you begin Throughout this guide, you use three open source projects to automatically set up, instrument, and tear down your infrastructure: Demo Deployer: The engine that drives the automation Demo Nodetron: A Node.js app that you run on your host. It presents a web page and an API, which you use to generate traffic. Demo New Relic Instrumentation: A project that instruments your host and application Each project is distinct, and encapsulates its own behavior. This maintains a separation of concerns and allows you to compose complex scenarios using a modular approach. Collaborate with us The Demo Deployer is currently in development. Because of our commitment to open source, we are working in the open early in the process and invite you to collaborate with us. Drop any thoughts and comments in the Build on New Relic support thread, and let us know what you think! The last thing you need before you get started is to install Docker if you don't have it already. Now that you have a high-level understanding of the tools you'll use, you can begin by building the Demo Deployer! Step 1 of 6 Build the deployer To use the deployer, first clone its repository from GitHub. Then, build a Docker image using the local copy of the code. First, clone the repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer.git Second, build the deployer Docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t deployer demo-deployer Now, you have a Docker image, named deployer, which you use throughout the rest of this guide. Step 2 of 6 Configure your credentials In this guide, you provision a host on AWS. The deployer uses a configuration file that contains your credentials for each service it communicates with so that it can invoke the necessary APIs. You can follow the User Config documentation in the deployer repository to set up each account and create your configuration file. In the end, you'll have a JSON file that contains credentials for AWS, New Relic, and GitHub: { \"credentials\": { \"aws\": { \"apiKey\": \"my_aws_api_key\", \"secretKey\": \"my_aws_secret_key\", \"secretKeyPath\": \"/path/to/my/secretkey.pem\", \"region\": \"my_aws_region\" }, \"newrelic\": { \"licenseKey\": \"my_new_relic_license_key\", \"accountId\": \"my_new_relic_account_id\" }, \"git\": { \"username\": \"my_git_access_token\" } } } Copy Name the credentials file creds.json, and store it‚Äîalong with your [keypair filename].pem file‚Äîin a directory called $HOME/configs. Step 3 of 6 Run the application Now that everything is set up, you can run the deployer application in a Docker container: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json With this command, you're running the deployer Docker container with the following options: -v mounts the $HOME/configs volume (where you stored your configuration files) at /mnt/deployer/configs/ in the container --entrypoint sets the default command for Docker to ruby Finally, you pass a list of arguments to the entrypoint, including: -c configs/creds.json: The user credentials configuration file -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json: The deployment configuration file Tip You can specify the log level for the deployer using -l. info is the default, but you can also use debug or error. This is a helpful option to use when something goes wrong. Once you run this command, the deployer will create and instrument some specific resources. This may take a few minutes. In the meantime, read on to learn more about what is actually happening during this process. Locating the user configuration files Notice, in the Docker command, that -c takes configs/creds.json. Also, you referenced your .pem file from configs/, as well. This is because you mounted $HOME/configs to /mnt/deployer/configs/ and /mnt/deployer/ is the working directory, according to the deployer's Dockerfile. So, you can access your user configuration files at configs/, which is a relative path from your working directory. Understanding the deployment configuration file The deployment configuration file, hello.json, which drives the deployer, contains four sections: services global_tags resources instrumentations These sections describe the actions the deployer executes. The first section is services: { \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"app1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-App1\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"port\": 5001, \"destinations\": [\"host1\"], \"files\": [ { \"destination_filepath\": \"engine/data/index.json\", \"content\": <some content> } ] } ] } Copy services defines one service, app1, which lives on host1 at port 5001. It uses the Demo Nodetron you learned about earlier in this guide as its source. Important In this example, some HTML has been removed for clarity. To run the deployer, you need to use the real content in hello.json. The second section is global_tags: { \"global_tags\": { \"dxOwningTeam\": \"DemoX\", \"dxEnvironment\": \"development\", \"dxDepartment\": \"Area51\", \"dxProduct\": \"Hello\" } } Copy global_tags defines tags for the deployer to apply to all the resources in your stack. These tags are an important part of organizing your New Relic entities. The third section is resources: { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"host1\", \"display_name\": \"Hello-Host1\", \"provider\": \"aws\", \"type\": \"ec2\", \"size\": \"t3.micro\" } ] } Copy resources defines one host, host1, which is a small EC2 instance on AWS. This host is referred to in the services section. The fourth, and final, section is instrumentations: { \"instrumentations\": { \"resources\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_infra\", \"resource_ids\": [\"host1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"1.12.1\" } ], \"services\": [ { \"id\": \"nr_node_agent\", \"service_ids\": [\"app1\"], \"provider\": \"newrelic\", \"source_repository\": \"-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git\", \"deploy_script_path\": \"deploy/node/linux/roles\", \"version\": \"6.11.0\" } ] } } Copy instrumentations configures, as the name implies, New Relic instrumentations for the host1 infrastructure and the app1 Node.js application. These definitions use the Demo New Relic Instrumentation project you learned about earlier. Step 4 of 6 Generate some traffic When deployer has run successfully, you will see a message that describes the resources deployed and services installed during the process: bash [INFO] Executing Deployment [‚úî] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful! Deployed Resources: host1 (aws/ec2): ip: 52.90.86.109 services: [\"app1\"] instrumentation: nr_infra: newrelic v1.12.1 Installed Services: app1: url: http://52.90.86.109:5001 instrumentation: nr_node_agent: newrelic v6.11.0 Completed at 2020-08-20 15:11:14 +0000 Visit your application by navigating to the app1 url in your browser: From there, you can follow the instructions to send traffic to New Relic. Important Your app1 url will be different than the url shown in this guide. Step 5 of 6 Check your tags After you've generated some traffic to your Node.js application, use the New Relic search redirect to find the resources you deployed: Once you have found your resources, select the service you deployed, Hello-App1. Then, click on the 'i' icon next to the name, which opens the metadata and tags modal: Notice that all the tags in the global_tags section of the deployment configuration show up under Tags: If you open the metadata modal for the host, you'll also see the global_tags. Step 6 of 6 Tear down your resources Because you've provisioned resources in your cloud account, you need to decommission them. You can do this with the deployer. Add the teardown flag, -t, to the end of your command: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json -t When the deployer has finished successfully, you'll see output that is similar to what you saw during deployment: bash [INFO] Executing Teardown [‚úî] Parsing and validating Teardown configuration success [‚úî] Provisioner success [‚úî] Uninstalling On-Host instrumentation success [‚úî] Uninstalling Services and instrumentations success [‚úî] Terminating infrastructure success [INFO] Teardown successful! Next steps Congratulations! Throughout this guide, you used the Demo Deployer to provision and instrument a host and application in AWS and automatically configured those entities with a list of tags. Next, try creating your own deployment configuration and change the global tags! One cool thing you can do is pass in a configuration file URL to the deployer. Here's one that uses a gist on GitHub: bash Copy $ docker run -it\\ > -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\\ > --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/creds.json -d https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markweitzel/d281fde8ca572ced6346dc25470790a5/raw/373166eb50929a0dd23ba5136abf2fa5caf3d369/MarksHelloDemoConfig.json",

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query personal API keys (user keys) in similar ways, replacing the ingest-specific fields with fields specific to the API. To understand the structure of these objects, you can experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete personal API keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a personal API key: Create a personal API key To create a personal API key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. 1. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } 2. Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } 3. Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you‚Äôll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it‚Äôs feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to: Organize all your entities efficiently. Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what. Easily find dashboards that visualize the entities or data you care about. Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. Learn more. Add, edit, and manage tags You can create and manage tags with New Relic NerdGraph. Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in New Relic One. If you're already familiar with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, see the following tutorials for sample queries: Manage tags: add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities Query entities: search for and see relationships between entities View tags and metadata for an entity After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways: UI: From the entity explorer, select an entity from the index. On the Summary page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID. API: Use NerdGraph to read the existing tags for an entity. After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as: Chart builder NerdGraph NRQL REST API Metadata descriptions and examples Metadata Description Account ID The New Relic account ID associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data. For example, if you know the Account ID, you can: Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account Account name The New Relic account name associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account. For example, you can use the Account name in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account. Agent version APM only The language agent version currently installed for this application. (If you want to check whether you have the most up-to-date version, see the specific agent's release notes.) App ID, Browser ID, Mobile ID The New Relic application ID for the specific type of entity. Entity GUID The globally unique identifier for a specific entity in New Relic. Also referred to as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Language agent APM only For APM agent's programming language. Specific language agents may offer additional features to view in the New Relic UI or to query your data. Tagging examples You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways: Use case Tags to use Form entities into logical groups Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI. Indicate ownership of the entity Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team. Rank entities by criticality Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones. Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers. Indicate facts about the entity Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running. Formatting and parameters When using tags, be aware of the following parameters: An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value. A key can have a maximum of 128 characters. A value can have a maximum of 256 characters. If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like key-name, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `key-name` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus. Use tags in New Relic One one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI. After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about. To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the Filter field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to. Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems. Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors In the APM agent configuration file settings, the labels field is used to add tags to your application data. If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Entity explorer. In the Filter with tags field, enter your APM or Synthetics label. Filter by infrastructure attributes If you use attributes with infrastructure monitoring, our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI. Examples of default tags created for a host include: hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net operatingsystem:linux agentversion:1.1.7 Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply team:my-team as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running.

      "body": "Legacy feature This document is for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers. Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Read on to learn more about how to do this. For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Create a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. The default streaming aggregation window duration is 1 minute. The minimum aggregation window is 30 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. Baseline thresholds don't support configurable aggregation window durations. They use the 1 minute default. You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate the streaming algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. If your data is sporadic or has aggregation windows that may not have data, you can fill those gaps with a custom value or the last known value. The default value is None. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a poliocy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Evaluation offset For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. Aggregation window and Offset evaluation toggles The total supported latency is the multiple of the aggregation window duration times the evaluation offset. In the screenshot example, the latency is 15 minutes (a 5 minute aggregation window X 3 windows). If the event type data comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. How to edit data gap values: In the NRQL conditions UI under Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with, and then choose None, Last known value, or Custom static value. In the Nerdgraph API (preferred), you'll find this node located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue In the REST API Explorer, you'll see this under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API. Gap filling options: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that‚Äôs present or missing in the stream of data coming into New Relic. The stream of data that comes into New Relic is called a signal. You can control what part of the signal is alerted on through NRQL conditions. These NRQL condition alerts are processed by the streaming algorithm. The NRQL query provides the signal filter for all of your incoming data. You can read more about the streaming alerts platform in this Explorers Hub post. Why it matters Alerts violations are easy when they're caused by a specific event happening, but trickier when looking for events not happening. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional offset delay allows for slower data to come through before it's processed. Once the aggregation window plus the offset time have elapsed, New Relic groups the aggregated data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation isn't triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools you can use to more effectively alert on your streaming data, giving you greater control and reducing the number of false alerts notifications. They are: Loss of signal detection Gap filling Aggregation window duration customization Offset evaluation This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Aggregation window In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. Alerts gathers data points together in an aggregation window, before using the aggregation function to evaluate the data. A longer aggregation window gives straggling data points more time to arrive before evaluating that data. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 1 second and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Offset evaluation For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. The offset time value is the number of aggregation windows you want to use. The duration for each window is set in the Aggregation window field. For example, if your aggregation window is 1 minute and your Offset evaluation is 3, then a straggling data point will have about 3 minutes to arrive before it might be dropped. In other words, streaming alerts will always keep 3 aggregation windows in the queue, waiting 1 minute before evaluating each window and adding a new one. The current default is 3.

      "body": "Serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda offers in-depth performance monitoring for your Lambda functions. Read on to learn how to enable this feature using our Lambda layer and get started using it. Using this feature may result in AWS charges. See Lambda monitoring requirements.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã How does it work When you enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda extension, this is what happens: Lambda monitoring with the New Relic Lambda layer You configure your Lambda function to include our layer for the runtime you've chosen. As your code runs, our Lambda layer gathers telemetry data about the invocation and its execution. Just before execution finishes, the Lambda layer sends the data it has gathered to the New Relic Lambda extension, which is bundled with the layer. The extension sends the data to New Relic, along with additional information from AWS Lambda. What's in the New Relic Lambda layer? The layer for your runtime contains the New Relic Lambda extension. This executable extends your Lambda function. The extension sends telemetry data to New Relic, and interacts with AWS directly to enhance the data we gather, while minimizing the impact of instrumentation on your application's performance. For Node.js and Python, the layer contains the New Relic agent code, and a wrapper for your Lambda handler. For other runtimes, we take an SDK approach, providing you with the tools to instrument your code, while taking advantage of emerging standards like OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry. What do you need To enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you need the following: AWS CLI v2 installed and configured using aws configure. Python version 3.3 or higher installed. newrelic-lambda CLI, which you can install by running pip install newrelic-lambda-cli. A New Relic account. You must be an admin, or have the Infrastructure manager add-on role. A personal API key. An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets. Note that you may need to use pip3 instead of pip if your system uses Python 2 by default. Enable serverless monitoring There are a few things that have to happen to let New Relic gather telemetry from your Lambda functions. Link your AWS account with your New Relic account. Configure each of your functions to include our Lambda extension. While there are several ways to accomplish both steps, this guide focuses on the most frequent setup scenario. Link your AWS account with your New Relic account When you link your AWS account to New Relic, you're granting permission to New Relic to create an inventory of your AWS account, and gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. Resources in your AWS account then show up as entities in the entity explorer, decorated with config information. When all the requirements are in place, link your AWS account with your New Relic account by running the following command using your personal API key (replace all the highlighted values): newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --linked-account-name YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME \\ --nr-api-key YOUR_NR_API_KEY \\ --enable-license-key-secret The newrelic-lambda CLI adds your New Relic License Key as a secret in AWS Secret Manager for greater security. The --linked-account-name parameter is to name the integration that will appear in New Relic. Storing the New Relic license key in the AWS Secrets Manager Your New Relic license key identifies and authenticates you to New Relic, allowing us to associate your telemetry with your New Relic account. Each function that sends telemetry needs access to this value, and it needs to be managed securely. The AWS Secrets Manager solves these problems. If your organization prevents you from using AWS Secrets Manager, see below for an alternative method to set your license key. Install or upgrade the Lambda layer After linking your accounts, you have to install or upgrade the New Relic Lambda layer to the latest version. All future layers versions will include the Lambda extension by default. To install/upgrade the layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --enable-extension --upgrade This command automatically finds the available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. If the layer can't be found, you can add a layer manually. To add the layer manually, read our example code. The --enable-extension flag sets the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to enable the extension. The Lambda extension is disabled by default. Deploy our examples and verify they work Once you've linked your AWS and New Relic accounts, instrumenting your Lambda function using our Lambda extension involves a series of steps: Pick an example and install it. Invoke the Lambda and see data in New Relic. Clean up and adapt the example to your code. We recommend trying out our example code for the following languages: Node.js Python Go Java .NET Each example contains instructions, sample code, and a deploy script to get started. After you've gotten the example to work for you, you can clean up by deleting the CloudFormation stack, using either the AWS Console, or the AWS CLI: aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name> Our examples are based on the AWS SAM CLI. There are other tools available for managing and deploying Lambda functions. New Relic offers a plugin for the Serverless Framework, and the CLI can modify your existing Lambda functions to add instrumentation. You can integrate the necessary Lambda layer and function permission using whatever AWS resource management tool you choose. Troubleshooting Cannot Use AWS Secrets Manager If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension will accept a NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable. Omit the --enable-license-key-secret flag from the newrelic-lambda integrations install command. Then Set this environment variable to your New Relic License Key in your Lambda function configuration. Multiple AWS regions and accounts The newrelic-lambda CLI should be run once per region, with the --aws-region parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The license key secret needs to be created in each region. Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The --aws-profile argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI. Failure to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN> What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: Adapt the example code to your Lambda functions to start monitoring production code. See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting. Use configuration settings to fine-tune your data.

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag‚Å† (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands.

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Back to top icon New Relic Browser Overview Features Resources New Relic Browser features Sign up for free Page Load Performance JavaScript Errors Browser Performance AJAX Global Features Security Page Load Performance New Relic Browser is the world‚Äôs most deployed Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution because it‚Äôs easy to use, and instantly connects end-user experience with time spent in backend services. From easy-to-understand overviews to user-centric perceived performance metrics and events, Browser helps you benchmark and improve web performance and troubleshoot across your full stack. Full Support for Google‚Äôs Core Web Vitals By adding Cumulative Layout Shift, a score measuring the impact of sudden unexpected shifts in layout due to content dynamically resizing, we now offer full support for all three of Google‚Äôs Core Web Vitals for web health. Use NRQL to create dashboards for all three measurements, definitions below: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - measures loading performance First Input Delay (FID) - measures interactivity Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - measures visual stability User Centric Perceived Performance Web performance teams can use more modern metrics than just page load time to benchmark and improve end-user experience for their dynamic pages. Browser helps developers understand how code impacts customers, answering key questions on page performance. Monitor how long users wait for content to display (paint metrics), how long until users can interact with our page (interactivity metrics), and how long until marquee content renders (largest contentful paint). (see blogpost for more) Single Page App Route Changes View Single Page Application route change performance, regardless of what JavaScript framework you use. Powerful low-level instrumentation can even capture interactions beyond the route change that can be customized via API, allowing monitoring tailored to the architecture of your application, such as for custom frameworks. Session Traces Session Traces provide one of the most valuable assets an engineer requires - context. Beyond identifying long load times, and specific errors, Browser Session Traces provide the story that occurred both before and after an error or performance issue. Pivot from AJAX requests and JavaScript errors into a Session Trace and conversely pivot from a Session Trace out to a specific JavaScript error or Network error. Browser Traces Traces are snapshots of one user‚Äôs experience, surfaced as an outlier due to a longer than average load time. It provides details around when it took place, a segmented breakdown of where load time was spent, browser type, and the user‚Äôs geographic location. This report is excellent when dissecting areas of your application which are performing poorly for specific users. Page Load Time - Segmentation Chart Page load times capture metrics from the moment a user begins a transaction in the browser until the page completes loading. The reports show average page load time broken down into color-coded segments for: Request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Page Load Time - Histogram and Percentiles Histograms and percentiles of browser page load times provide a holistic view of the speed of page loads, one that is not focused on averages alone. Histograms and percentiles surface every page load that occurred during a specified time window, providing the ability to drill into outliers that might have been overlooked otherwise. Geographic Reporting Understand how your end users‚Äô experience with your site varies by geographical region. Identify if more CDN‚Äôs are required, or if high value customers in specific parts of the world are having a negative experience with your site‚Äôs performance. Page-Level AJAX Calls For a specific page, see all the AJAX calls being made as well as the response time, throughput (rpm), total number of calls, error status codes, and average data transfer made for each one. Page View Throughput Throughput is measured in requests per per minute. Throughput metrics help you understand which pages are being called most frequently. Connect Browser with Backend Performance From the Page views report, you can select single page URL and see all of the associated backend APM transactions (if you have the APM Agent installed in your application). Quickly view the total call time, average response time, and call count for any individual backend transaction. You can also dive deeper into a particular transaction and see diagnostics within our APM reports. JavaScript Errors The JavaScript error dashboards help you identify production JavaScript errors impacting your users' experiences and begin pinpointing how to resolve them. JavaScript Error Summary This summary view gives you a high level understanding of the types of JavaScript errors happening, the frequency at which they occur, and the percentage of users affected by the errors. Errors by Browser For each type of error, this chart shows you which browsers are being impacted by the error and the relative contribution it is making to your total error volume. Percentage of Page Views with Errors For each type of error, this chart shows you the percentage of page views affected by it. This allows you to quickly assess the reach and impact a particular error has on your end users. Source Map Support Troubleshoot minified production JavaScript code, with source map support giving you full visibility to where in your code the front-end error is. Intuitive drag-and-drop lets you locate issues in a click, while API integrations work seamlessly with your build pipeline. Best-in-class Customer Experience Monitoring Crash analysis in New Relic Mobile lets you analyze the most impactful crashes and fix them faster. Source map support in New Relic Browser gives you more actionable visibility into front-end JS errors by showing you exactly where in the original source the error occurred, even if your code is minified. Browser Performance New Relic's Browser dashboards provide information about your end users' experience based on browser type and version, so you can understand where to focus your time testing and optimizing for performance. Browser Throughput Provides a snapshot of the average number of pageviews received per minute broken down by browser type. Browser Load Time - Segmentation Chart For each type of browser, a segmented view of time spent on request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Browser Version Chart Helps you understand which versions of each browser type your customers come from based on throughput. Error Instance Details Error Instance details grabs a snapshot of a single error and captures the stack trace details available from the browser, focusing on the actionable components, down to the line of code. These are metrics are combined with unique browser combinations down to the version level, and unique url. JavaScript diagnostics doesn't get more granular than this. AJAX If your applications use AJAX to update parts of a webpage after the initial page load, our AJAX dashboards will provide you with the level of visibility you need to understand how those requests are performing and ultimately affecting your users‚Äô experience. AJAX Dashboard The main AJAX dashboard surfaces your site‚Äôs most resource intensive AJAX requests, filterable by time consumption, response time, throughput, callback time, and data transfer. From here you can drill into a particular call for detailed analysis. Calls by Page View Shows which page views are calling a particular server side controller, with page level detail around throughput, response time, total number of calls, and data transfer. Request Status Codes The status codes reporting indicates the return behavior from an AJAX call. A large number of non-200 status codes may indicate a problem with your AJAX endpoints. Data Transfer Per Request This shows data transfer which is requested and sent. Use this to look for correlations between high callback times and data transfer rates. Global Features The following features are used throughout New Relic‚Äôs product suite to help make our products easier to use and fit seamlessly into your existing workflows. Quickly View App Health New Relic uses color coded status indicators throughout to help you quickly spot performance issues.

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, you can be notified of unusual app behavior and access an automatic analysis of this unusual behavior. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are automatically available in NRDB for dashboarding, alerting, and integration with Incident Intelligence. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in an overview of anomalies, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you can choose to just save the events to NRDB. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomaly overview page, which lists all recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside the activity stream on the New Relic One homepage and the APM Summary page you will see relevant anomalies for applications that you've configured with Proactive Detection. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream will bring up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed on applications to monitor To receive notifications in Slackthe Applied Intelligence Slack application installed into your Slack workspace by an IT administrator. For more details, see Data limits. Set up Proactive Detection You can configure this feature in the Proactive Detection UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection to go to Configuration. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Select the golden signals you would like to monitor for anomalies. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app‚Äôs warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly‚Äôs behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View Anomaly overview UI In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, Proactive Detection also includes a UI view with more information about the anomalies in your environment. This provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account. You can also select each anomaly to view a detailed analysis. Use anomaly events with NRDB Once you configure Proactive Detection, anomaly events will be sent to New Relic‚Äôs database (NRDB). You can query NRDB for Proactive Detection anomaly events and use them in conjunction with other Applied Intelligence tools. Query for Proactive Detection events from NRDB You can use NRQL to query NRDB for any Proactive Detection events recorded over the previous 7 days: FROM ProactiveDetection SELECT * Attribute Description anomaly.deliveredAt Number The time at which the anomaly event was initially recorded, in epoch milliseconds. Example: 1584366819000 anomaly.description String A brief description of the anomaly event.

Automatic anomaly detection Get notified about potential problems in your tools of choice before they turn into incidents. Applied Intelligence proactively monitors your services for anomalies based on SRE golden signals‚Äîsuch as latency, errors, and traffic‚Äîand notifies you with real-time failure warnings and actionable details so you can investigate faster. See all anomalies in one place with access to deeper analysis Visualize and troubleshoot all anomalies across your environment from a single page, with the ability to instantly view critical details for each one. Anomaly analysis includes key attributes that caused spikes, related signals to investigate root cause by looking at what happened around the anomaly, and visibility into upstream and downstream dependencies. Correlate incidents to reduce alert noise and fatigue Automatically group and prioritize your alerts and incident data to decrease noise and focus on what matters most. Applied Intelligence establishes relationships between incidents and includes flapping detection and smart suppression to reduce noise from low-priority alerts by as much as 90 percent. Correlate incidents with your own decision logic Build and gauge the impact of your own correlation logic with an intuitive decision builder that makes it simple to tell New Relic AI what data to compare and correlate, then previews its potential impact. You can create logic based on any event attribute, adjust frequency and duration thresholds, and even choose out-of-the-box similarity algorithms, so you get full flexibility and control. Get transparency into why incidents are correlated AIOps tools shouldn‚Äôt be a black box. Applied Intelligence provides full transparency into why and how issues are correlated, so you have confidence in the ML models that reduce noise while ensuring that critical signals don‚Äôt go unnoticed. Diagnose and respond faster with incident intelligence Applied Intelligence enriches correlated incidents with deeper context and metadata, so you can understand the issue and take action to resolve it. Alerts are automatically classified based on golden signals and related components of your environments are identified, so you can quickly determine the probable cause and isolate the source of the problem. Escalate incidents to the right responders faster Route correlated incidents to the team members best equipped to respond and make noisy, misdirected alerts a thing of the past. Applied Intelligence suggests responders based on your data, and gives you the flexibility to easily determine where and how you send issues to your teams. ¬† No changes to your existing incident response workflow Connect your incident management tools as destinations quickly and easily. Applied Intelligence delivers correlated, enriched incidents into tools like PagerDuty, OpsGenie, ServiceNow, and more, so you don‚Äôt need to reinvent your on-call workflow. ¬† Experience Applied Intelligence Applied Intelligence delivers guidance and analysis that makes it faster and easier than ever to detect, understand and resolve incidents.

On this page, you‚Äôll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you‚Äôre authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you‚Äôre authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours? Existing usage data can also be a helpful research input. 3. Define SLOs Using the research on customer expectations that you gathered, draft a focused set of SLOs. New Relic recommends setting SLOs against one or more of the following SLIs: Application availability percentage Average response time Response percentile Error rate Apdex value Also, consider instrumenting and tracking the following SLIs: Throughput (peak and trough) Database call count and duration DNS and SSL timing DOM processing and page rendering Mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) For a more comprehensive list of potential areas to measure, see Measuring DevOps. Recommendation: To determine if your application is performing to customer expectations: Consider combining multiple SLIs (for example, availability and response time) into one SLO. Aim to define a consistent set of conditions across all of the services in your list. Consult your team and stakeholders to validate that the SLOs you set are reasonable, consistently attainable (even if you are not currently meeting them), and aligned to customer expectations. After you finish this step, you should have a set of well-defined SLOs and SLIs. 4. Determine what can be instrumented Now you're ready to deploy agents or monitors to establish a performance baseline for the SLIs you created. With proper instrumentation in place, you'll have visibility into the performance indicators that matter for your team and your customers. In addition, you'll also have a clear understanding of how to meet your SLOs. Identify the service components your team will optimize. Verify which application tiers meet New Relic monitoring requirements. To ensure you have robust baselines from which to work, determine the level of instrumentation that is possible (or allowed) within your organization. It's best practice to instrument everything you can, but there may be situations where instrumentation isn't viable. In that case, you should determine what other data is available or can be created. For example, you can gather logs to query them for SLO data and set alerts for them. If the application has a web front end in these situations, use New Relic Synthetics. Synthetics offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. To instrument the example applications and components in this tutorial, use these New Relic features: New Relic products Customer type Component name Tier owner Language stack Server OS New Relic products External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Internal Service 2 Jane A. .Net Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX APM, Plugins External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Synthetics Internal MS SQL Dave Z. NA Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host integration APM installation After reviewing the compatibility and requirements for New Relic APM, install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language agent type. Follow the installation procedures for specific APM agents. Infrastructure installation After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, follow the installation procedures to install the Infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. The New Relic Infrastructure agent requires the following host permissions: Linux: To install and run the agent, you must have root privileges. Windows: To install and run the agent, you must have Administrator privileges. Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations based on their availability. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, including MySQL, Apache, NGINX, and more. For more information, see New Relic's on-host integrations documentation. Synthetics New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. Follow the procedures to create a simple browser check. Be sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the Synthetics public network locations. Browser New Relic Browser provides deep insights into how your users are interacting with your application or website. Browser complements Synthetics with data based on actual user experiences, which is useful in discerning how DevOps efforts are ultimately improving the experience for the customer. For more information, see the compatibility and requirements, then install the New Relic Browser agent. Mobile The growing role of mobile apps in customer experience often spurs new performance data needs. Installation of New Relic Mobile lets DevOps teams instrument iOS and Android applications to gain a fuller understanding of service delivery quality. Plugins Developers can use the New Relic Plugins product to create plugins that monitor numerical metrics provided by external services, hosts, or equipment. You can install existing plugins from Plugin Central, or plan, develop, test, and create your own plugins. 5. Review the default metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, use service maps to review the default metrics that New Relic captures. For example, a typical service map show many of the common SLIs that application teams rely on, including response time, Apdex, throughput, and error rate metrics from APM. It also shows page load time, Ajax response, throughput, and error rate from Browser. rpm.newrelic.com > Service maps: To explore detailed granularity for any area, use the service map's nodes. 6. Set up custom instrumentation To close any remaining gaps in visibility for your SLIs, use custom instrumentation. New Relic provides several avenues for adding custom instrumentation, including: Making API calls to agents from inside your source code Packaging XML-based custom instrumentation modules with deployed applications Adding UI-based instrumentation without a code deploy In addition, you can add custom attributes to each transaction event that match application performance factors to critical business information. Then you can track those attributes in Insights dashboards. For more information, see the custom instrumentation documentation for your application: APM Browser Infrastructure Insights Mobile Synthetics 7. Create Insights dashboards to track SLIs Once you implement the appropriate instrumentation, it is easy to visualize your service level indicators with New Relic Insights dashboards. Insights provides a single location to query and view all the data that New Relic products gather. For example, Insights helps visualize the following data gathered from New Relic products: Infrastructure: Use default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network; Infrastructure integrations; and custom attributes. APM: Use Transaction and TransactionError event types. Browser: Use PageView and PageAction event types. Mobile: Use several Mobile event types. Synthetics: Use SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types. Each event has an event type, a timestamp, and one or more key attributes. For more information about the data that New Relic receives from your app, see Data collection. To query and view the data from the SLIs you selected for baselining: Use the Insights Data explorer to create widgets for your dashboards. Create dashboards that include widgets for the SLI baseline data. Use these widgets and dashboards to establish team dashboards that you can share and use to conduct operations reviews. insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Query your SLI baseline data, create dashboards with widgets to visualize the data, then share with your team and stakeholders.‚Äã The metrics you capture will become your application's baseline. Share your Insights dashboard with your application team and stakeholders to provide visibility into what is happening with your application and to monitor future performance.

Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you‚Äôll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it‚Äôs feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog.

Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our entity explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the entity explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date, the new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it‚Äôs grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn‚Äôt retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time.

One way to quickly check the user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, these users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of pricing plan and user models. View and manage users To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. User types: basic user and full user On the Users and roles UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. This only affects your account once you've switched to the New Relic One pricing plan, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. Your users on our original user model remain on that user model (and use these original user docs) and additionally have the new full/basic categorization. To learn more, see Transition to new pricing. You can also bulk update changes to user type. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select plus-circle New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select pencil Edit role or trash-o Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. fa-check Change the account Owner. fa-check Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. fa-check fa-check Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Manage flexible data retention. fa-check Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One fa-check fa-check Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Recommendation: Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. Note that changing the logging level requires you to restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: Run with a task suite (CLI option) to scope your troubleshooting. The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options, or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. View suites To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option. ./nrdiag --help suites Run suites Suites are run by providing the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. System Command line flag Linux, macOS For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at rpm.newrelic.com, then select Help > Get support. Select View open tickets, then select the ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. Upload results to a support ticket If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you would like to inspect or modify the contents of this file before upload, follow the manual upload process. System Command line flag Linux, macOS, Synthetics private minion ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Pass command line options These command line options are available for the Diagnostics CLI: Option Usage -a STRING -attachment-key STRING Attachment key for automatic upload to a support ticket. -browser-url STRING Diagnostics CLI version 1.1.9 or higher When invoked, this will only run Browser-related diagnostics checks.This command checks for the presence of the New Relic Browser agent and returns the agent version, the injection method (via APM or via copy/paste), and the Browser loader type (Pro, Lite, SPA). This can be used to provide detail to New Relic Support when troubleshooting intranet sites. -c STRING -config-file STRING Override default agent configuration file location. Can be used to specify either a folder to search in addition to the default folders, or a path to a specific configuration file. -file-upload STRING Diagnostics CLI version 1.1.8 or higher Requires running with -a option. Allows upload of a single file at the path specified. This is in addition to files collected by default. --filter STRING Filter task results by result status. Accepts a comma separated list. Accepts: Success, Warning, Failure, Error, None. -h --help Displays full list of options. -help tasks will provide a full list of available tasks. -output-path STRING Specifies a different directory to write the results (nrdiag-output.zip, nrdiag-output.json and nrdiag-filelist.txt). Default location is ./ -o --override Pass in arguments to override. This should generally only be done when requested by New Relic Support. Example syntax: --override Java/Config/Agent.Status=Success -p STRING --proxy STRING Provide proxy to be used in HTTP connection tasks. Can be HTTP or HTTPS. Proxy should be in the format https://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-pw STRING Proxy password, if necessary. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-user STRING Proxy username, if necessary. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -s STRING --suites STRING Run a suite, a collection of tasks that target specific products or issues. You can specify multiple suites by separating them with commas. For a list of all suites, run: ./nrdiag -h suites -t STRING --tasks STRING Run only a subset of tasks, either by agent or by task type. You can specify multiple tasks by separating them with commas. For a list of all tasks, run: ./nrdiag -h tasks -usage-opt-out Decline to send anonymous Diagnostics CLI tool usage data to New Relic for this run. -v --verbose Display verbose logging during check execution. Disabled by default. --version Display current Diagnostics CLI version. This also prompts to check for a newer version and prompts to download if a newer version is available. -y --yes Say yes to any prompt that comes up while running. Disabled by default. Validate your config file settings The Diagnostics CLI now features more detailed configuration setting validation. Currently the Java agent's newrelic.yml file is supported, and support for other agents' configuration files is planned, if you have an urgent need for a specific agent let us know here. If you run nrdiag in the usual manner (on the system running your application with the New Relic agent already installed) the new validation will be applied automatically, and any warnings will be shown. You can also use this feature as a linter to validate a config file before deployment. Do this by running the appropriate task and providing the path to your config file. For example, if your newrelic.yml and nrdiag are both in the current directory, you can run the following command to lint the config file: ./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml. The screenshot below shows an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The agent_enabled setting in this case has a value of \"yes\", but the Java agent only accepts the values \"true\" or \"false\" (this misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running). When enable your agent incorrectly, you see a message like this describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed. Interpret the output After executing the Diagnostics CLI from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a Warning or Failure status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation: The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it found with your installation, along with troubleshooting suggestions. File output The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files: Diagnostics output files Comments nrdiag-output.zip A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to support tickets. This archive also contains a copy of nrdiag-output.json nrdiag-output.json Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to tickets. nrdiag-filelist.txt A list of files found. The nrdiag-output.zip file that you attach to support tickets automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this .txt file separately. Result status codes The Diagnostics CLI returns the following status codes after running: Status code Definition Success Task successfully executed with no issues detected. Warning Task successfully executed. However, possible issues detected. Failure Task failed with issues detected. Error Task unable to execute. This could be due to a permissions issues. None Task was determined irrelevant to detected environment and was not executed. Run the Diagnostics CLI in a Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container you can use the docker exec command as follows: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Licensing and security The use of the Diagnostics CLI is subject to this license agreement, as well as licensing agreements for open-source software used by the Diagnostics CLI. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy. The Diagnostics CLI inspects system information and New Relic product artifacts (logs and config files) that are relevant for performing diagnostic checks that assess New Relic product configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. Data uploaded to support tickets The Diagnostics CLI does allow uploading of this information to a support ticket over HTTPS if you use a specific command-line argument. You will be prompted before the collection of any files that we expect to have sensitive information. Before the collected files contained within nrdiag-output.zip are uploaded to New Relic, you will also be prompted. This allows you to review and edit any information that you do not want to provide. (For example, the nrdiag-output.zip will include your user name.) You also have the option to cancel the upload altogether. Data storage Any support ticket attachments made using NR Diag or containing NR Diag data that are less than or equal to 20MB are stored by Zendesk. Otherwise these attachments are stored by New Relic. For more information, see Zendesk's privacy and data protection policies. Environment variables The Diagnostics CLI examines the following environment variables to perform diagnostic checks. The values of these variables are recorded locally in the nrdiag-output.json file.

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag‚Å† (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Download latest version The Diagnostics CLI (nrdiag) is a utility that automatically detects common problems with New Relic products. If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks the configuration of your agents for issues and can generate zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetics: CPM The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although New Relic does recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Run the Diagnostics CLI To use the Diagnostics CLI: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Recommendation: Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. Note that changing the logging level requires you to restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: Run with a task suite (CLI option) to scope your troubleshooting. The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options, or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. View suites To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option. ./nrdiag --help suites Run suites Suites are run by providing the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. System Command line flag Linux, macOS For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at rpm.newrelic.com, then select Help > Get support. Select View open tickets, then select the ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. Upload results to a support ticket If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you would like to inspect or modify the contents of this file before upload, follow the manual upload process. System Command line flag Linux, macOS, Synthetics private minion ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Windows To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Pass command line options These command line options are available for the Diagnostics CLI: Option Usage -a STRING -attachment-key STRING Attachment key for automatic upload to a support ticket. -browser-url STRING Diagnostics CLI version 1.1.9 or higher When invoked, this will only run Browser-related diagnostics checks.This command checks for the presence of the New Relic Browser agent and returns the agent version, the injection method (via APM or via copy/paste), and the Browser loader type (Pro, Lite, SPA). This can be used to provide detail to New Relic Support when troubleshooting intranet sites. -c STRING -config-file STRING Override default agent configuration file location. Can be used to specify either a folder to search in addition to the default folders, or a path to a specific configuration file. -file-upload STRING Diagnostics CLI version 1.1.8 or higher Requires running with -a option. Allows upload of a single file at the path specified. This is in addition to files collected by default. --filter STRING Filter task results by result status. Accepts a comma separated list. Accepts: Success, Warning, Failure, Error, None. -h --help Displays full list of options. -help tasks will provide a full list of available tasks. -output-path STRING Specifies a different directory to write the results (nrdiag-output.zip, nrdiag-output.json and nrdiag-filelist.txt). Default location is ./ -o --override Pass in arguments to override. This should generally only be done when requested by New Relic Support. Example syntax: --override Java/Config/Agent.Status=Success -p STRING --proxy STRING Provide proxy to be used in HTTP connection tasks. Can be HTTP or HTTPS. Proxy should be in the format https://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-pw STRING Proxy password, if necessary. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -proxy-user STRING Proxy username, if necessary. If the Diagnostics CLI finds a proxy in the agent config file, it will use that proxy by default. -s STRING --suites STRING Run a suite, a collection of tasks that target specific products or issues. You can specify multiple suites by separating them with commas. For a list of all suites, run: ./nrdiag -h suites -t STRING --tasks STRING Run only a subset of tasks, either by agent or by task type. You can specify multiple tasks by separating them with commas. For a list of all tasks, run: ./nrdiag -h tasks -usage-opt-out Decline to send anonymous Diagnostics CLI tool usage data to New Relic for this run. -v --verbose Display verbose logging during check execution. Disabled by default. --version Display current Diagnostics CLI version. This also prompts to check for a newer version and prompts to download if a newer version is available. -y --yes Say yes to any prompt that comes up while running. Disabled by default. Validate your config file settings The Diagnostics CLI now features more detailed configuration setting validation. Currently the Java agent's newrelic.yml file is supported, and support for other agents' configuration files is planned, if you have an urgent need for a specific agent let us know here. If you run nrdiag in the usual manner (on the system running your application with the New Relic agent already installed) the new validation will be applied automatically, and any warnings will be shown. You can also use this feature as a linter to validate a config file before deployment. Do this by running the appropriate task and providing the path to your config file. For example, if your newrelic.yml and nrdiag are both in the current directory, you can run the following command to lint the config file: ./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml. The screenshot below shows an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The agent_enabled setting in this case has a value of \"yes\", but the Java agent only accepts the values \"true\" or \"false\" (this misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running). When enable your agent incorrectly, you see a message like this describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed. Interpret the output After executing the Diagnostics CLI from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a Warning or Failure status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation: The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it found with your installation, along with troubleshooting suggestions. File output The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files: Diagnostics output files Comments nrdiag-output.zip A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to support tickets. This archive also contains a copy of nrdiag-output.json nrdiag-output.json Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to tickets. nrdiag-filelist.txt A list of files found. The nrdiag-output.zip file that you attach to support tickets automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this .txt file separately. Result status codes The Diagnostics CLI returns the following status codes after running: Status code Definition Success Task successfully executed with no issues detected. Warning Task successfully executed. However, possible issues detected. Failure Task failed with issues detected. Error Task unable to execute. This could be due to a permissions issues. None Task was determined irrelevant to detected environment and was not executed. Run the Diagnostics CLI in a Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container you can use the docker exec command as follows: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Licensing and security The use of the Diagnostics CLI is subject to this license agreement, as well as licensing agreements for open-source software used by the Diagnostics CLI. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy. The Diagnostics CLI inspects system information and New Relic product artifacts (logs and config files) that are relevant for performing diagnostic checks that assess New Relic product configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. Data uploaded to support tickets The Diagnostics CLI does allow uploading of this information to a support ticket over HTTPS if you use a specific command-line argument. You will be prompted before the collection of any files that we expect to have sensitive information. Before the collected files contained within nrdiag-output.zip are uploaded to New Relic, you will also be prompted. This allows you to review and edit any information that you do not want to provide. (For example, the nrdiag-output.zip will include your user name.) You also have the option to cancel the upload altogether. Data storage Any support ticket attachments made using NR Diag or containing NR Diag data that are less than or equal to 20MB are stored by Zendesk. Otherwise these attachments are stored by New Relic. For more information, see Zendesk's privacy and data protection policies. Environment variables The Diagnostics CLI examines the following environment variables to perform diagnostic checks. The values of these variables are recorded locally in the nrdiag-output.json file. Any environment variable containing NEWRELIC or NEW_RELIC Any environment variable beginning with NRIA PATH HOME RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV LOCALAPPDATA DOTNET_SDK_VERSION DOTNET_INSTALL_PATH COR_PROFILER COR_PROFILER_PATH COR_ENABLE_PROFILER CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING CORECLR_PROFILER CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH ProgramFiles ProgramData APPDATA JBOSS_HOME JAVA_VERSION_MAJOR JAVA_VERSION_MINOR JAVA_VERSION_BUILD JAVA_PACKAGE JAVA_JCE JAVA_HOME GLIBC_REPO GLIBC_VERSION LANG WORKDIR MINION_JAR DEFAULT_LOCALE_CFG_FILE MINION_PROVIDER MINION_USER MINION_GROUP MINION_LOG_LEVEL DOCKER_API_VERSION DOCKER_HOST MINION_API_ENDPOINT MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT MINION_API_PROXY MINION_API_PROXY_SELF_SIGNED_CERT MINION_CHECK_TIMEOUT MINION_DOCKER_API_VERSION MINION_DOCKER_HOST MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR MINION_JVM_MB MINION_JVM_OPTS For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "Here are some best practices designed to help you become a New Relic APM master and a key asset to your team.",
      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master‚Äîand a key asset to your team! To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the entity explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application‚Äôs historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends‚Äîall great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic‚Äôs SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization‚Äôs SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.

      "body": "New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system, and how to improve it. With New Relic, you can: Bring all your data together: Instrument everything and import data from across your technology stack using our agents, integrations, and APIs, and access it from a single UI. Analyze your data: Get all your data at your fingertips to find the root causes of problems and optimize your systems. Build dashboards and charts or use our powerful query language. Respond to incidents quickly: Our machine learning solution proactively detects and explains anomalies and warns you before they become problems. Develop New Relic apps: Create your own New Relic One applications to suit the needs of your team or company. Use our extensive development resources to reduce development time. All the answers in one place New Relic is built for Full-Stack Observability. It links all relevant data so that you get the whole picture of everything that enables your systems to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. Monitoring vs Observability: New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. As just one example of what you can do with New Relic, imagine you are a Kubernetes administrator overseeing many clusters and pods of software containers. Where do you start troubleshooting? This short video shows how you can locate a problem cluster and drill through transaction traces to relevant logs: Bring all your data together Capture, organize, and make sense of your data in our Telemetry Data Platform‚Äîno matter where it comes from. Use our agents and integrations to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools, or use our APIs for data that‚Äôs more specific to your business or technology. If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see a larger list at New Relic integrations. If you want to... New Relic can help you... Instrument your application Instrument your code: Use our APM agents to automatically instrument your applications in C, Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Track transactions: Gather distributed tracing details as your transactions cross boundaries between apps and services. Instrument your environment Instrument your infrastructure: Observe your entire environment (including Linux, Windows, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, and more). Collect and centralize logs: See your log data in context with your other application and infrastructure data. Save time switching between tools and reach solutions more quickly.

Query your data programmatically: Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor. Respond to incidents faster DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently. Let Applied Intelligence, our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents. Proactive detection: Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. Get notifications: Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified. Develop with New Relic With New Relic you can build your own observability app to answer unique business, IT, and operational questions, using the same data that you brought in.

      "body": "You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Read on to learn about the New Relic containerized private minion (CPM), a Docker container-based private minion that accepts and executes synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for New Relic right now. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see the Prometheus High Availability resource. Set up the integration From the Prometheus remote write setup page, complete these steps. Enter a name for the Prometheus server you‚Äôre connecting to and your remote_write URL. The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data, and will be the name used to identify which Prometheus server you're connecting to. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. A good place to add this information is under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. We recommend to use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Alternatively, you could use this configuration: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME If you are completing the remote write integration using Kubernetes and Helm, you should instead add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the example below. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearerToken:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Restart your Prometheus server. View your data. Add Prometheus data Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Customize remote write behavior You may be interested in customizing the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. Details: If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts you should use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. You should use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to get data flowing properly. For detailed information about common errors including missing or incorrect characters, bad request errors, request entity too large errors, rate limit errors and the associated fixes, see Remote write errors and error messages. Remove the integration To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file and restart the server. When you remove the integration, this stops new data from flowing, but will not purge or remove any historical data.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Read on to learn more about how to do this. For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Create a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. The default streaming aggregation window duration is 1 minute. The minimum aggregation window is 30 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. Baseline thresholds don't support configurable aggregation window durations. They use the 1 minute default. You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate the streaming algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. If your data is sporadic or has aggregation windows that may not have data, you can fill those gaps with a custom value or the last known value. The default value is None. To learn more about gap filling and how to request access to it, see this announcement Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Create a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a poliocy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Evaluation offset For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. Aggregation window and Offset evaluation toggles The total supported latency is the multiple of the aggregation window duration times the evaluation offset. In the screenshot example, the latency is 15 minutes (a 5 minute aggregation window X 3 windows). If the event type data comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. How to edit data gap values: In the NRQL conditions UI under Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with, and then choose None, Last known value, or Custom static value. In the Nerdgraph API (preferred), you'll find this node located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue In the REST API Explorer, you'll see this under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API. Gap filling options: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours.

      "info": "Explains how to use the SLIDE BY clause with TIMESERIES to smooth out ",
      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here‚Äôs a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction New Relic Browser events, like PageView New Relic Mobile events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:‚Äã SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ‚úî Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ‚úî PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ‚úî pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ‚úî pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json üõ† Built artifact files for: ‚Åé 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ‚úî ‚úî Nerdpack built successfully! ‚òÖ Starting as orchestrator... ‚úî Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ‚Ü© Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! üõ† Built artifact files for: ‚Åé 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ‚úî ‚úî Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components.

(You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div.

      "body": "Add a time picker 20 min This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1‚Äì4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you‚Äôll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the PlatformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the PlatformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "info": "How to use the Node.js API to name, rename, and ignore requests, and to read router names with New Relic's Node.js agent.",
      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic‚Äôs error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic‚Äôs error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end([callback]) Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable New Relic Browser. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Optional rules attributes Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Naming rule examples Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.

These attribute settings apply to Node.js agent version 2.7.1 or higher. If you use an older version of the agent, see Update legacy attribute configuration. Find and use attributes New Relic attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of event and transaction data. Attributes can help you gain greater insight into your application and annotate the data in New Relic. Attributes (both default and custom) can be found in: APM transaction traces and error analytics APM events Browser events You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. As of Node.js agent version 6.10.0, when you enable distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing, information from Transaction events is applied to the currently available Span of the transaction. Because of this, you may want to apply the attribute settings for Transaction events to Span events or apply them as global attribute settings. Node.js-specific attributes In addition to the default APM attributes, the Node.js agent collects attributes from these sources: HTTP response codes The response status code for a web request. The key for this attribute is httpResponseCode. The default setting for each destination is: Transaction traces: Enabled Error analytics: Enabled APM events: Enabled Browser events: Disabled Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is removed as of agent version 7.0.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. HTTP response messages The response status message if present for a web request. The key for this attribute is httpResponseMessage. The default setting for each destination is: Transaction traces: Enabled Error analytics: Enabled APM events: Enabled Browser events: Disabled Note: The httpResponseMessage attribute (string value) is removed as of agent version 7.0.0. http.statusText (string value) should be used instead. Custom attributes Attributes added to an addCustomAttribute() call to the Node.js agent API. The key name for this attribute depends on what you specify when you call the method. The default setting for each destination is: Transaction traces: Enabled Error analytics: Enabled APM events: Enabled Browser events: Disabled Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur. noticeError() API calls Attributes added to a noticeError() call on the Node.js agent API. The key name for this attribute depends on what you specify when you call the method. The default setting for each destination is: Transaction traces: Unavailable Error analytics: Enabled APM events: Unavailable Browser events: Unavailable Request and response headers The Node.js agent can capture response and request headers as attributes. By default, the Node.js agent will collect all request headers that are not excluded. Excluded HTTP request headers by default: request.headers.cookie request.headers.authorization request.headers.proxy-authorization request.headers.set-cookie* request.headers.x-* Captured response header: response.headers.content-type You can disable collecting all the headers by setting allow_all_headers to false in your newrelic.js file. The default setting for each destination is: Transaction traces: Enabled Error analytics: Enabled APM events: Enabled Browser events: Disabled Request parameters Request parameters from the transaction. The Node.js agent captures GET parameters by default. In order to capture POST parameters, use the addCustomAttribute() Node.js agent API call. Configure attributes You can customize what types of attributes the Node.js agent sends to each destination. This is most common for security reasons, when you have certain sensitive attributes you do not want reported to New Relic. Use the following configuration properties along with the attribute rules to enable or disable attributes: allow_all_headers Enabled by default. Set this to false for the agent to only collect a subset of headers. attributes.include_enabled Enabled by default. Set this to false to disable the attributes.include array. destination.attributes.enabled Destination Configuration option Default All attributes.enabled True Transaction traces transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled True Error analytics error_collector.attributes.enabled True APM events transaction_events.attributes.enabled True Browser events browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled False Enable or disable attributes entirely. If you set a destination to false, no attributes will be sent to that destination regardless of your include/exclude settings. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. destination.attributes.include Destination Configuration option Default All attributes.include (none) Transaction traces transaction_tracer.attributes.include (none) Error analytics error_collector.attributes.include (none) APM events transaction_events.attributes.include (none) Browser events browser_monitoring.attributes.include (none) Specify particular attribute keys you want the agent to report to New Relic. For all destinations, this is a list of strings that is empty by default. The .exclude properties override the .include properties. To disable all .include values, set attributes.include_enabled to false. destination.attributes.exclude Destination Configuration option Default All attributes.exclude (none) Transaction traces transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude (none) Error analytics error_collector.attributes.exclude (none) APM events transaction_events.attributes.exclude (none) Browser events browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude (none) Specify particular attribute keys you do not want the agent to report to New Relic. For all destinations this is a list of strings that is empty by default. The .exclude properties override the .include properties. Attribute rules The Node.js agent follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination: Setting attributes.enabled to false overrides all other settings. If you set the main attributes.enabled property to false, the agent does not report any attributes at all. Disable all attributes Agent configuration: attributes.enabled: false attributes.include: request.parameters.* error_collector.attributes.enabled: true Input keys: foo bar request.parameters.foo request.parameters.bar Agent output: Transaction traces: No attributes Error analytics: No attributes APM events: No attributes Browser events: No attributes Setting a destination to false overrides include/exclude. When you set enabled to false for a destination, the agent ignores your include/exclude settings and not report any attributes for that destination. Disable one destination Agent configuration: transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false attributes.include: one, two* transaction_tracer.attributes.include: three, four Input keys: one two three four Agent output: Transaction traces: No attributes Error analytics: one, two APM events: one, two Browser events: No attributes Exclude overrides include. The .exclude properties override the .include properties. Conflict between include and exclude settings Agent configuration: attributes.enabled: true attributes.include: foo, myCustomAtt attributes.exclude: password, myCustomAtt Input keys: foo myCustomAtt password Agent output: Transaction traces: foo Error analytics: foo APM events: foo Browser events: foo More specific rules take priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Conflicts with specific settings Agent configuration: attributes.enabled: true attributes.include: foo, myCustomAtt attributes.exclude: password, myCustomAtt browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled: true Input keys: food food.bread food.fruit.banana food.fruit.apple Agent output: Transaction traces: food.fruit.apple Error analytics: food.fruit.banana, food.fruit.apple APM events: food.fruit.banana, food.fruit.apple Browser events: food.fruit.banana, food.fruit.apple Keys are case-sensitive.

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you‚Äôll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it‚Äôs feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ‚úî Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ‚úî PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ‚úî pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ‚úî pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json üõ† Built artifact files for: ‚Åé 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ‚úî ‚úî Nerdpack built successfully! ‚òÖ Starting as orchestrator... ‚úî Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ‚Ü© Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! üõ† Built artifact files for: ‚Åé 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ‚úî ‚úî Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

      "body": "A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to: Organize all your entities efficiently. Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what. Easily find dashboards that visualize the entities or data you care about. Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. Learn more. Add, edit, and manage tags You can create and manage tags with New Relic NerdGraph. Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in New Relic One. If you're already familiar with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, see the following tutorials for sample queries: Manage tags: add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities Query entities: search for and see relationships between entities View tags and metadata for an entity After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways: UI: From the entity explorer, select an entity from the index. On the Summary page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID. API: Use NerdGraph to read the existing tags for an entity. After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as: Chart builder NerdGraph NRQL REST API Metadata descriptions and examples Metadata Description Account ID The New Relic account ID associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data. For example, if you know the Account ID, you can: Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account Account name The New Relic account name associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account. For example, you can use the Account name in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account. Agent version APM only The language agent version currently installed for this application. (If you want to check whether you have the most up-to-date version, see the specific agent's release notes.) App ID, Browser ID, Mobile ID The New Relic application ID for the specific type of entity. Entity GUID The globally unique identifier for a specific entity in New Relic. Also referred to as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Language agent APM only For APM agent's programming language. Specific language agents may offer additional features to view in the New Relic UI or to query your data. Tagging examples You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways: Use case Tags to use Form entities into logical groups Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI. Indicate ownership of the entity Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team. Rank entities by criticality Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones. Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers. Indicate facts about the entity Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running. Formatting and parameters When using tags, be aware of the following parameters: An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value. A key can have a maximum of 128 characters. A value can have a maximum of 256 characters. If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like key-name, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `key-name` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus. Use tags in New Relic One one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI. After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about. To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the Filter field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to. Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems. Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors In the APM agent configuration file settings, the labels field is used to add tags to your application data. If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Entity explorer. In the Filter with tags field, enter your APM or Synthetics label. Filter by infrastructure attributes If you use attributes with infrastructure monitoring, our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI. Examples of default tags created for a host include: hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net operatingsystem:linux agentversion:1.1.7 Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply team:my-team as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed.

      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. bash Copy $ # curl version $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' $ $ # New Relic CLI version $ newrelic nerdgraph query '{ $ actor { $ user { $ name $ email $ } $ account(id: 12345678) $ } $ } $ ' Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launchers ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-launcher ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nerdlets ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-nerdlet-nerdlet ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js-tokens ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loose-envify ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ object-assign ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prop-types ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-dom ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-is ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nr1.json ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One SDK To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it‚Äôs a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span‚Äôs duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.

From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they‚Äôve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren‚Äôt an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",
